\caption[The frequency matrix of augmented CopeOpi scores]{The frequency matrix of augmented CopeOpi scores.\\
In the frequency matrix of augmented CopeOpi scores,
each row represents a unique word $w_i$ and
the two columns represent two corpora of labeled documents $\mathbb{D}_p$ and $\mathbb{D}_n$.
The elements $fp_{w_i}$ and $fn_{w_i}$ are the frequencies of word $w_i$ 
in corpus $\mathbb{D}_p$ and in corpus $\mathbb{D}_n$.}
