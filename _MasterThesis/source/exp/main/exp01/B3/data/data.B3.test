2	From: pstlb@aurora.alaska.edu Subject: Where did the hacker ethic go? Lines: 46 Nntp-Posting-Host: acad3.alaska.edu Organization: University of Alaska Fairbanks A great many computer programmers read "Dr. Dobb's Journal". In a recent issue, there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read. It said: "There's nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer industry. The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90's." Where has the hacker ethic gone? Not the "cracker" ethic, which is something entirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the free distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative? Why is it that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able to have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry? Why is it that, if a person like myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks, crannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any useful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely ignored) Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to make truly innovative products? I ask those of you who call yourselves hackers, why is this? And further, how can you let it go on? It is a fact that the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so for a long time to come. It has allowed the propagation of information in a volume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller than it was before. I shudder to think what that world will be like if the corporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the 286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public. That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of innovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me. In fact, I applaud it; that is the American way. But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative systems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the problem. And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for blunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time. I put it to you thus: Where HAS the hacker ethic gone? If it still exists, where? And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves "hackers" allowing this to perpetuate itself? Why are they not creating new, innovative, interesting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the computer industry? I await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence. +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | pstlb@acad3.alaska.edu | "Revenge is a dish best served cold." | | "Szechuan Death" | - Khan Singh | | | "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"| +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+	0

I have read a few articles about this and know that two solutions exist: parity counting and angle sumation. Both ideas are pretty simple but coding is not. So I wonder if there exists public domain source code for this. Another 'rough' solition (don't care special cases) is ray-casting which is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces consisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used (M. Tamminen, et. al., 1984. "Ray-casting and block model conversion using a spatial index". Computer-Aided-Designs. 4, 1984, 60-65). But the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have their normal pointing outside of polyhedra. How this could be done in practice ? I have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. How could I ensure their normals pointing outside the polyhedra ? The paper mentioned above assumed this is already the case. I have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden line removal. It says "if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointing toward viewer standing far away from the polyhedra...". Again how to make sure ? Any pointers are welcome ?

Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high refresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features. The card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local bus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL). With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers maximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate of 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 non-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater than standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video standards. WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa's FlickerFree(tm) technology, which eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more comfortable. the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility developed by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen and thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors. WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed offered by the new VESA Local bus technology. Most VL bus cards will only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will transfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz. Genoa is also offering this card in the "TurboBahn" combination packaged with their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard. Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator, WINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance value. Genoa's advanced proprietary drivers act to "turbocharge" the chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with power and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced chip cards. The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and reliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D Studio, OS/2, OrCAD and more. Driver updates and product bulletins are available on Genoa's BBS at (408) 943-1231. Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of graphics adapters, motherboards, audio and multimedia cards for IBM-compatible personal computers. All products come with a two year limited warranty on parts and labor. Genoa products are currently distributed worldwide through authorized distributors, resellers, VARs and systems integrators.

I am looking for any material related to the field, and am also trying to get my hands on some easy to use packages related to the field. In particular source code for general use packages. I already have several texts on the subject, but would appreciate more input from people more knowledgable in the field than myself. I'm not mathematically literate (ie. I don't have a degree in mathematics), so any material that is suggested I would prefer that it was not mathematically intensive. The best book I have found on the subject at the moment is: "Practical Digital Image Processing" by Rhys Lewis ISBN: 0-13-683525-2 Published by Ellis Horwood (c)1990. Likewise I am trying to get a fair sample of programs that demonstrate Image Processing techniques. So far I have 'xv', and 'khoros' for Unix. 'Dcview 2.1' for the IBM PC, and various related smatterings of C code to help describe topics like, contrasting, dithering, image enhancement via convolution etc. If anyone could kindly supply me with some public domain software pertinent to this area, or better still if they could tell me where I am most likely to find it on the AARNET (Internet). If I can I would prefer source code in C or Turbo Pascal that includes some Image Processing code/algorithms, that I can readily alter/manipulate for the purposes of demonstration it would be most helpful. All the above information will contribute to my post-graduate studies, and will be liberally used in my paper, and seminar on the subject.

I'm using Kochanek-Bartels splines (as described in the SIGGRAPH '84 proceedings) to create a variable number of inbetweens between the key frames. I want the inbetweens to be given in the form (x,y,z,dx,dy,dz) where the last three argumentsa are the x, y and z component of the viewing direction vector of the camera when positioned at (x,y,z). The method presented by Kochanek and Bartels only deals with the positions of the inbetween view points to be generated. I've tried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the chord between the two adjacent view points (which in general are not key frames), but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the viewing direction vector at the key frame positions (although the spatial movement seems to work fine; and I'm quite certain - I think :) - that I've not simply made an implementation error...) Now I wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for similar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display ========================================================== PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software) ====================== IMDISP ------ IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display, enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions [PC and Macs] LabVIEW 2 --------- LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements. Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a wiring tool to create the block diagram (program). Functions that the block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc. The tool allows any Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual instrument. National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP) boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time acquisition and analysis at a personal computer. New software tools for DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block diagram development software. There are three levels of DSP programming associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW: Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300. Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level programming of the DSP hardware. This approach offers the highest level of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use. Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has utility functions for memory management data communications and downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for the development of custom code.) Ultimage Concept VI ------------------- Concept VI by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems. A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography, surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging, electronic microscopy and remote sensing. Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further qualitative and quantitative analysis. It includes a complete set of functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and characterization. The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane. Standard input and output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD. Other formats can be imported. Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic operations, and geometric transformations, among others. Morphological transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others. Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and morphological distribution. Measures include area, perimeter, center of gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and shape factors and equivalence. Measures are saved in ASCII format. The program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom modules. A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot. The histogram tool can be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc. There are 13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local intensity. These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines. The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude) data. The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening and defining objects or for removing artifacts. The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even hole filling. The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area, perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points. GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494 707-579-1733 IPLab Spectrum -------------- IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI. Using scripting tools, the user tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a movie command for cycling through windows. Macintosh-based tools ===================== NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more --------------------------------- NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results from numerical modelling calculations. These applications, documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been developed by Spyglass. Spyglass, Inc. 701 Devonshire Drive Champaign, IL 61820 (217) 355-6000 fax: 217 355 8925 NIH IMAGE --------- Available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably) zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image. It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language, tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel, though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version from zippy.nimh.nih.gov) PhotoMac -------- Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700 PhotoPress ---------- Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973 PixelTools and TCL-Image ------------------------ "Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

TCL-Image: "Software package for scientific, quantitative image processing and analysis. It provides a complete language for the capture, enhancement, and extraction of quantitative information from gray-scale images. TCL_Image has over 200 functions for image processing, and contains the other elements needed in a full programming language for algorithm development -- variables and control structures. It is easily extensible through "script" (or indirect command) files. These script files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands. They are executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters. The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame grabber boards. TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF." Perceptics 725 Pellissippi Parkway Knoxville, TN 37933 615-966-9200 Satellite Image Workshop ------------------------ It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all sorts of image enhancing on it.

Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112 Adobe Photoshop --------------- The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey scale. Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS applications. These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush. Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated. For example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%, allowing you to create ghost overlays. RPhoto-editingS tools include control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation modification and spectrum equalization. Images can be subjected to various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image, blur edges, or locate edges. Image scaling is also supported. For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG, availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF, EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint, PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan.. Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA 94039-7900 415-961-4400 ColorStudio and ImageStudio --------------------------- ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and therefore more difficult to use. Several steps are often required to accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop. The application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can easily end up with images in the 30 MB range. The program provides a variety of powerful selection tools including the "auto selection tool" which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close hues, color range and mask. ImageStudio: Don't know... Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100 Dapple Systems -------------- "High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of global or feature parameters, and interpret the data." Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283 Digital Darkroom ---------------- The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to select part of an image simply by "painting" it. A new polyline selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide selections. A brush lets the operator "paint" with a selected portion of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool. This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale images only. It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio. Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd., Suite J San Diego, CA 92126 619-695-6956 Dimple ------ It is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching tool and it is very good for this purpose." "Dimple runs on a colour Macintosh. It is a product still in its development phase.. i.e. it doesn't have all the inbuilt features of other packages, but is coming along nicely. It has its own inbuilt language for writing "programs" for processing an image, defining convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down menus etc... It is unprotected software." Process Software Solutions, PO Box 2110, Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. 2500. Phone 61 42 261757 Fax 61 42 264190. Enhance ------- Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter variations: "Laplacian, medium noise filter", etc. Files can be saved as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported). MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA 50322 515-270-8109 Image Analyst ------------- An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative data from video images. Image Analyst lets users configure sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the necessity of knowing a programming language. It is designed for such tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in radiographs. Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically. Image Analyst works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or a disk-stored image. Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image. Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images. Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and position. The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices. There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user defines. Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI) represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image. Inside a ROI, the program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape, the thickness of a wall, etc. Image Analyst finds the center, edge and other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

I have used RSVGA with 6 of 7 Landsat bands and it is a good starter program except for the obtuse manual" IMAGINE-32 ---------- It's a 32 bit package [I suppose for PCs] called "Imagine32" or "Image32" The program does a modest amount of image processing --add, subtract, multiply, divide, display, and plot an x or y cut across the image. It can also display a number of images simultaneously. The company is CompuScope, in Santa Barbara, CA. PC Vista -------- It was announced in the 1989 August edition of PASP. It is known to be available from Mike Richmond, whose email addresses have been richmond@bllac.berkeley.edu richmond@bkyast.berkeley.edu and his s-mail address is: Michael Richmond,Astronomy Department, Campbell Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 The latest version of PC-Vista, version 1.7, includes not only the source code and help files, but also a complete set of executable programs and a number of sample FITS images. If you do wish to use the source code, you will need Microsoft C, version 5.0 or later; other compilers may work, but will require substantial modifications.

SOFTWARE TOOLS -------------- It's a set of software "tools" put out by Canyon State Systems and Software. They are not free, but rather cheap at about $30 I heard. It will handle most all of the formats used by frame grabber software. MIRAGE ------ It's image processing software written by Jim Gunn at the Astrophysics Dept at Princeton. It will run on a PC among other platforms. It is a Forth based system - i.e. a Forth language with many image processing displaying functions built in. DATA TRANSLATION SOURCE BOOK ---------------------------- The Data Translation company in Massachusetts publishes a free book containing vendors of data analysis hardware and software which is compatible with Data Translation and other frame grabbers. Surely you can find much more PC-related stuff in it. MAXEN386 -------- A couple of Canadians have written a program named MAXEN386 which does maximum entropy image deconvolution. Their company is named Digital Signal Processing Software, or something like that, and the software is mentioned in an article in Astronomy Magazine, either Jan or Feb 92 (an article on CCD's vs film). JANDEL SCIENTIFIC (JAVA) ------------------------ Another software package (JAVA) is put out by Jandel Scientific. Jandel Scientific, 65 Koch Road, Corte Madera, CA 94925, (415) 924-8640, (800) 874-1888.

Email to iraf@noao.edu for more details. Apparently this is one of the _de facto_ standards in the astronomical image community. They issue a newsletter also. They seem to support very well their users. Works with VMS also last I heard, and practically has its own shell on top of the VMS/Unix shells. It's suggested that you get a copy of saoimage for display under X windows. Very flexible/extendable -- tons (literally 3 linear feet) of documentation for the general user, skilled user, and programmer. ALV --- A Sun-specific image toolkit. Version 2.0.6 posted to comp.sources.sun on 11dec89. Also available via email to alv-users-request@cs.bris.ac.uk. AIPS ---- Astronomical Image Processing System. Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits) Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville, VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV). Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT, or (non-anonymous) internet ftp. Documentation (PostScript mostly) available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103), directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL. Installation requires building the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler. This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a synthesis instrument. It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy. There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based graphics tool built into AIPS. The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and can do image arithmetic, etc. The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI. There is currently a project - "AIPS++" - underway to rewrite the algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an object oriented approach. Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and Australia to name a few. LABOimage --------- (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.

DISIMP ------ (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in interactive times. Feature Description DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of modules. Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and ratioing. Host Configuration Requirements Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times. DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific applications programs. Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables, colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be interactively driven through this control. A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be added to further enhance referenced imagery. The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The purchase price includes all functionality required for professional processing of remote sensed data.

Select a chunk of five band data from a pass, automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically and carefree. It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that difficult to write your own with their programmer's module. Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy. Runs on HP9000 with HP-UX. Supports 24-bit display" HIPS ---- (Human Information Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System) Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image processing which has been used for basically all the usual image processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil exploration, etc.). It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of multiband images in the same way it deals with single images. It has been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well as a huge user-contributed library. Feature description HIPS is a set of image processing modules which together provide a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research, system development and teaching. It handles sequences of images (movies) in precisely the same manner as single frames. Programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform processing, edge detection and line drawing manipulation, digital image compression and transmission methods, noise generation, and image statistics computation. Over 150 such image transformation programs have been developed. As a result, almost any image processing task can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows users to easily integrate their own custom routines. New users become effective using HIPS on their first day. HIPS features images that are self-documenting. Each image stored in the system contains a history of the transformations that have been applied to that image. HIPS includes a small set of subroutines which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header, and a large library of image transformation tools in the form of UNIX ``filters''. It comes complete with source code, on-line manual pages, and on-line documentation. Host Configuration Requirements Originally developed at New York University, HIPS now represents one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environments currently available. It runs under the UNIX operating system. It is modular and flexible, provides automatic documentation of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment. HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and Microvax, Sun, Apollo, Masscomp, NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc. For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and Sun-386i consoles. We also supply user-contributed drivers for a number of other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata, Macintosh II, X windowing system, and Iris). The Hipsaddon package includes an interface for the CRS-4000. It is a simple matter to interface HIPS with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with users who have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max- Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other image display devices because 98% of HIPS is machine independent. Availability HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible system, both as an interactive research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or Sun cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ] MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis. MIRA gives workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in 256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2- dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware. The entire graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize the speed of windowing operations. Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value value in real time as you move the mouse. There are also smooth, real time contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other palettes can be generated. Supported functions include such niceties as the following: o image & image: + - / * interpolation o image & constant: + - / * o unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log, byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient, line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel. Ellipse, rectangle, line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to any specified angle. o CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to region target mean, median, or modal value. o create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image, collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of region of an image. o review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot keyword values for a set of images. o luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry, brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical aperture shape to image isophotes. o interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,` centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times, change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function or histogram equalization. o interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for registration. o interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or 2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers can be cycled through. Interactive data analysis: polynomial fitting, point deletion, undelete, change value, point weighting, linear and quadratic loess and binomial smoothing, revert to unit point weights or original data buffer, substitute results into data buffer for pass back to calling function. Dump data buffer (+ overlays and error bars) to file or printer. Change to user specified coordinate system. o Tricolor image combination and display, hardcopy halftone printout to HP-PCL compatible printers (Laserjet, deskjet, etc.) o Documentation is over 300 pages in custom vinyl binder.

People seem perfectly capable >dealing with these others. Well, yeah, but unlike TIFF they all do substantially more than encode rectangular bitmaps. And the others are hardly trouble free. I hear that it is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate. The annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the 50 useful options, there are 100 stupid options. The most egregious example is that rather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently in all TIFF files, byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers on all machines, no matter what their natural byte order, have to be prepared to do byte swapping. There are four slightly different FAX formats -- again, any one of them would have been adequate. RGB images can be stored by pixel or by component, complexity without function, etc, etc. I also note that the TIFF doc says that Aldus' experiments show that LZW reliably compresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats, suggesting that none of the FAX formats are really useful. What's worse, a lot of the formats aren't even implemented very well, e.g., LZW limits code words to 12 bits, while 14 or 16 bits would have provided substantially better compression. And the LZW method compresses bytes rather than pixels. But the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can register proprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them. This means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliably read all incoming TIFF files. Some standard. Regards, John Levine, johnl@iecc.cambridge.ma.us, {spdcc|ima|world}!iecc!johnl	0

A 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the application. It may let you - manipulate application data, the camera, 3-D objects in the scene and so on, or - view the status of the application or 3-D objects via the widget's shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or - do whatever I missed but you think is possible. For example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as a partially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated. A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects. The length of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the ruler indicating the distance. A widget can provide both manipulation and feedback. For example, the ruler can be used to change the distance between the objects along its own axis. Please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3-D interaction. The information I gathered will help me design a 3-D UI construction tool. Your help is very much appreciated.

52	From: ttknock@SantaFe.edu (Boss Hogg) Subject: POV animating Organization: The Santa Fe Institute Lines: 20 NNTP-Posting-Host: sanjuan.santafe.ede X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8] In an attempt to do animation with POV I have created two little programs. One is a C program that will perform a "morph" between any two points given the amount of frames for the morph. And then it will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) out to a file. Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions and insert them into a .pov file at a given line. I had hoped this would let me do simple animation. However, I have discovered that simply performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary object but will actually rotate the object about the axis. Now I know an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the origin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there must be another way around this. I had thought perhaps it was because I had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new point and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. However this occurs on objects that are not translated at all. Any help is appreciated. ttknock@bbs.santafe.edu	0

Speaking of SIGGRAPH, I just went through the ordeal of my annual registration for SIGGRAPH and re-upping of membership in the ACM last night, and was I ever grossed out! The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery! For example: SIGGRAPH basic fee went from $26 last year to $59 this year for the same thing, a 127% increase. Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the annual conference could reduce this to $27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite, which means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $32 (or so) for the proceedings and the art show catalog, essentially. TOPLAS went up 40% in cost, way outstripping the current inflation rate. Basic SIGCHI fees remainded the same, but whereas before SIGCHI membership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings, these are now an extra cost option. Bundling that back into the basic rate, equivalent services have gone up 100% in cost. SIGOIS membership cost has up 33%, but they've also split out the Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to be included with membership. Adding that cost back in means this SIG also has doubled its membership fee. What really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months ago touting their new approach to providing member services, and tried to make it sound like they were offering NEW services. But with the exception of a couple, like SIGGRAPH, all the "plus" services appear to be just splitting the costs into smaller piles so that they don't look so big. But their recommended changes to my membership would have me paying 90% more than last year for a 31% increase in services (measured by cost, not by value), and, curiously, a 31% inflation rate on the publications I got last year.

You can edit individual pallette entries or do global colour changes; crop, scale etc. Clearly the program must save out the *altered* image else all your work would be thrown away. So yes it saves out 8 bit images - of course! XV can import 24 bit images and quantises them down to 8 bits. This is a handy facility, not a bug. How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated. If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much more powerfull software - which is readily available commercially. And lastly, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It can be applied to any image of arbitrary bit depth. Again, this is not a bug.

Most JPEG viewers seem to require specific video drivers since they support only specific video cards. Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for the VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such as the Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picture quality if your dithering works right). I can't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG's to GIF's before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards. You don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGA card and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+ computers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a 8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to write some programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and other colour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinberg dithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette the resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would when viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but it does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my way gives a brighter more detailed image. Anyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, as far as I know, you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than the VGA (and perhaps a 286 or better) Have a day!

Something about planes or something, and writing to ports and the like, but I don't know the numbers or anything -- for the 16 color modes, I think. If I'm wrong, let me know. Also, 320x200x256 is just one byte/pixel; that's easy enough, but are there any other ways to write to the screen, perhaps bytes at a time, or something like that? Of course, I'd appreciate any information about any mode.... which reminds me of another question -- do the SuperVGA modes work the same, generally, as the normal 16 and 256 color modes, or is not only the mode numbers for various cards different, but the methods for writing to the screen different as well? Thanks for any help you can give me... I'm developing a screen class for C++ and find myself searching for information. Oh, I do have Ralf Brown's Interrupt List, which has given me tons of invaluable information already. It just doesn't go into the screen programming details (except for the read/write pixel BIOS calls...

I was looking thru it, but I didn't get the idea how to determine the size of a pic in pixel without decoding the whole image. How do you get the height and width of a JPEG in a JFIF? How do you determine wether it is a color or a greyscale picture? I wrote a small tool (lsgif) for GIF that returns the filesize, picture size and color resolution by analizing the header chunks. The output looks like this: 157605 bla.gif 640x 480 248C24 I use this lsgif to create index files of my archive and since JPEG are getting more and more popular I would like to have a similar tool for JFIF, with an output like this: 57605 bla.jpg 640x 480 C24 Please respond by email, because I don't read this news group very often.

So you post and say it is not a bug, you never said it was, I have misunderstood etc. Now you are saying: >We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit, If you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the discussion a *lot* easier. ---------------- >So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is, there >must be a colormap anyway.

No I don't think so actually. You were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv (by quantising), manipulating the colours in the colour editor, then somewhow applying these changes to the 24 bit file when you exit xv. Xv lets you edit individual colours. Where is this sudden jumping off the topic? >My solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit >image Yes I am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file!! >-- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.

What are you saying ??? >XV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the >mentioned type images. Ah! now we see thew problem! First you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8 bit previews of 24 bit images. Then I point out problems with this. Now you are saying there is no problem because you, personally, happen not to use those parts of the program that cause the problem!! >Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global >changes.

You don't seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the next. OK, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one through. >>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv? >It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not >designed for that. As I said in the last post, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It is a way of saving disk space by trading off quality against compression. I fail to see what the problem is. You have not proposed any workable alternatives. >Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; Speak for yourself. You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who, having quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow reverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made to the 8 bit image palette. Perhaps that is why you yused the singular? >say, >person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is >expected that the image still is the same. Look, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit image. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit file. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing. >So, XV were designed >without thinking about human interface and how human expect the >program work -- design error. Is a design error the same as a bug? ;-) Read my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets you import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the human interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it was designed for. It makes no false claims. >I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but >it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making >major change to the original design. If you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. So far, you have not done so. >So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved >images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit. Argh!! After all this, a comment like that. `Very easily'. OK, go ahead and code it if it is so easy. Or alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'. >Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where >'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes >up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however, >even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem. >(Americans: the lift is just an example :) I think this is a bit of an exageration.

This is due to a missing XRESOLUTION and YRESOLUTION tag which apparently is required (or at least believed to be required) for valid TIFF. I have checked both xv 2.x and xv 3.x and neither of these do indeed copy these tags. Has anyone out there hacked in the fixes for xv to support these tags? I have been told that I could find some code in tiff/tools/tiffcp.c, but that directory is one of many of the tiff group not distributed with xv.

The schematic shows a central DMA Engine connecting and mediating between two Graphics Animation processors (32 bit bus), a 32-bit RISC processor with math co-processor, Video Decomp module, a control port, an expansion port (where 3DO hangs its double-fast CD player), 1Mb DRAM, an optional video port (for editing video) and on the outbound side 1MB VRAM to Video Processor to TV chain parallel with a DSP to sound chain. They promise Red Book CD-quality audio, full 30 fps video and a future connection path to your PC via a PC expansion card.

Since this was posted on comp.ai, I assume there is an AI angle to this. Hacking is what AI students do when they're really supposed to be doing something else, e.g. thesis research & write up, getting their supervisors' pet programs to run properly, etc. No-one gets much glory for hacking, and no-one gets any money out of it. Producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time & resources that not many people can, or want to, afford - particularly during a recession. In addition, over the last 10 years, I think there has been a de-emphasis on producing running programs in AI research, and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to problem-solving. Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs. At a conference a year or two ago, Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should 'Get back to the keyboard' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas - and I have to say I'm inclined to agree.

I need help finding a company that will take photographic images scanned in and modified by Adobe Photoshop and turn them into thermal prints or negatives. I am looking for a place as close to North Carolina as possible. The images will be created on a Macintosh Quadra 800 running Adobe Photoshop and will then be stored in whatever format the vendor requires, perhaps 88M cartridges? The images will be black and white photographs scanned in with a 1200 dpi scanner then modified/corrected by Adobe Photoshop. If anyone could help me or even give me phone numbers to people who could I would be very grateful. Also if anyone else is doing what I am planning I would be happy to hear from you with any advice you might provide as to the computer system you use and/or any peripherals or software. It seemed the Quadra 800 would be my best bet to modify photographic images. I am planning on buying a Quadra 800 with 32Megs of RAM, a 510Meg Hard Drive, a 1200 dpi scanner, 17" Sony monitor and a 88Meg cartridge drive and perhaps a CD ROM.

Keywords: raytracer colours realism vectors Organization: Computer Science Department, University of Cape Town Lines: 25 I have a question about recursive, backward raytracing. When an incident ray (I) strikes an object at point P, first the normal (N) is calculated. Light rays are calculated (L1 to Ln where n is the number of light sources) - these being the light rays that do not intersect with anything. The reflected ray (R) and the transmitted ray (T) is calculated from the formulae. Calling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours along the rays (R and T) as rCol and tCol. Each object has its own colour oCol and each light source has liCol (1 <= i <= n). The question is: How do you combine rCol, tCol, oCol and all the liCol's to get the correct resulting colour to return along the I ray? All colours are defined as strucures (records) having r, g, b components between 0 and 1. If anyone has done this before could you give me a few hints? -- Adrian Secchia asecchia@cs.uct.ac.za	0

I'm thinking to treat the raw data.. not >compressed. Actually, for digital HDTV systems that's far higher bandwidth than you need, unless there's some reason you must work in fully-uncompressed HDTV. Also, my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6MB, even using 24 bits/pixel (which is more bits than you actually need - 15 or 18 should be enough for a moving picture). 1600x1100x16bits is 3.5MB (I'm guessing at HDTV resolution - it may be a bit wider than 1600, I'm fairly sure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals). I hope you have a very fast memory system as well - 180MB/s while displaying will require a heavily interleaved VRAM system. Unless you have a _very_ compelling reason, I'd advise trying to use at least somewhat compressed data.

I have an IBM-compatible notebook computer with an LCD VGA screen. While I was working with it this morning, the screen started to flicker a little, which I thought was odd since I do use a surge-protector for my computer and all peripherals. It only did this for a second and then stopped. I left the room for several minutes and, when I returned, the screen was completely dim, not blank, but very very dim. The contrast slider still worked so that I could adjust it to where I could *faintly* make out what was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely *no* effect. I was plugged-in at the time (i.e., not using the battery) but I still tried switching the battery, changing the power-saver features, etc., etc., all to no avail. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? If this just means that I need to replace the screen then I guess I'll have to but I thought that the "death" of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually happened. I didn't want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the net about this because I already know what they'll say: "Yep, you gotta have this replaced and it's gonna cost you $???." I've only had the computer for about 21 months. Is that a reasonable life cycle for a LCD display? Oh, I guess I ought to give specifics here: the brand is Compudyne (Is this a reputable company?), it's a 386SX @ 20 MHz. I forget the model number exactly and I was too ticked off to write it down before coming in to work today. If anyone can help me, PLEASE give me any advice you might have. I'm not opposed to having it replaced, but I'd rather not if it's not absolutely necessary. If you wouldn't mind, please e-mail me at mike@mik.uky.edu but if you'd rather post I'll be checking back here in a couple of days. BTW, if the answer to this question is already in a FAQ somewhere, feel free to flame away but I would ask that you also include the location and name of the FAQ if you don't mind.

136	From: abig@netcom.com (Access Bus Industry Gp) Subject: ACCESS.bus (Re: ACCESS.bus Software Creator's Contest) Organization: NETCOM On-line Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest) Lines: 92 Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator's Contest Announcement) WHAT IS ACCESS.bus? ACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer peripheral connectivity. ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that uses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to a single PC port. Peripheral devices such as keyboards or keypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC. Applications such as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, Multiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more can now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts Plug and Play on every PC. The ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of systems and peripherals. Multiple devices connect to the host computer with only one port. Common communication methods for a number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software development. As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross- platform use of the same device. ACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION: ===================================== ACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without fee or royalty. ACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture. That is, a single host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices. ACCESS.bus data rate is 100 Kbits/sec. ACCESS.bus Physical Layer ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware protocol, with one data line and one clock line. Standard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock synchronization. ACCESS.bus Software Protocols ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three levels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol. I2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines arbitration among contending masters without losing data. I2C provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with different clock rates. Bus transactions include addressing, framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the receiver. BASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between a host computer and multiple peripherals. The host becomes the ACCESS.bus manager. The Base Protocol defines the format of an ACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with additional semantics, including checksum. Unique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot plugging. Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches. Hot plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the system is running, without rebooting. APPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular types of devices. Each type requires a different Application Protocol. Three broad device types have been identified: keyboards, locators, and text devices. ACCESS.bus support on the PC ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ All three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the PC. An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices. An ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 - controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with the ACCESS.bus device drivers. Drivers are available for multiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and Windows 3.1. Also available are C language source code examples of the interface from applications to the device drivers.

I'm sure you will receive other suggestions but look at it this way. If you wanted to provide a full network connection to Linux over a modem would you use SLIP/PPP or would you invent some new way? Most people would say that SLIP/PPP exist and are reasonably well designed protocols, so lets just implement them. I see it the same way with NAPLPS. It is an existing, well thought out, extensible protocol for online graphics, so why not implement it. If you need any advice on implementation, just e-mail me.

Well for starters, why use rle files? You might have a specific program that needs them, OK, but I tend to convert straight to jpeg format, thus a 2.4meg 24bit targa file becomes a ~80k or less 24bit jpeg. The latest versions of XV (2.2.1 ?) and xloadimage (3.03) both handle jpeg files. And the best way to convert to jpeg is with the c/djpeg suit. Even at 90% quality (you can't see the difference) the jpeg is way smaller than anything else even an 8bit gif!

146	From: ldo@waikato.ac.nz (Lawrence D'Oliveiro, Waikato University) Subject: QuickTime performance (was Re: Rumours about 3DO ???) Organization: University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand Lines: 67 OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime, the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I'd do some more tests. First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor). I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results (for better or for worse). I pulled out a copy of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I had recorded off TV a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only 5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames. I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor, keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default "2.00" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten frames. I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same "Raw Speed Test" program I used for the results I'd been reporting earlier. Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second. That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback. I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240 size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1... Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps. The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with "preferred" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback). A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task switching. A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell. I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance even more...

I guess I edited my note on this away from the article I posted to many newsgroups. I wrote something about making color modifications quickly with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image. This makes sense, because the main use of XV is only viewing images. Doing many changes to image, we should keep all modifications in a buffer; and then before making the operations to 24bit image, we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations. >And lastly, JPEG is a compression algorithm.

No, MIS folks have infinite budgets of death, and they also get parts of their budget allocated "upgrades", "maintenance", and "new purchases", and a lot of IBM mainframe purchases are actually "leases" and so is the software. Basically, the engineers who have tight budgets, i.e. the coders and designers of a company, bitch and moan when they drop 15,000 on a Sparc 1 only to see a faster machine appear a year later. MIS types upgrade once every 5-10 years, and their costs are amortized and depreciated over a longer period, and the budget office justifies the expense because they actually use the machines for accounting, payroll, etc. Now, if the budget office was dependant on the engineers for some reason like payroll and accounts, you'd sure as hell see every engineer with a new Cray on his desktop every year. :-) Brian	0

152	From: lioness@maple.circa.ufl.edu Subject: Kubota vs. E&S Freedome Organization: Center for Instructional and Research Computing Activities Lines: 70 Reply-To: LIONESS@ufcc.ufl.edu NNTP-Posting-Host: maple.circa.ufl.edu More people have been asking for information on the Kubota graphics workstations, so here is some more info on the Kenai/Denali vs. the E&S Freedom. Here is the text of a Denali vs. E&S Freedom done by D.H. Brown Associates. ------ Denali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics subsystem in several aspects of its high-level design. Both products use a parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations. Both have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of pixel processors. As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly in performance and functionality. Both design teams also appear to have similar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market penetration. There remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and E&S products. Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end developer's dream system with plenty of performance potential and flexibility. In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to sixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at a higher price and performance levels than Denali. All Freedom systems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that support a broader variety of color blending functions. The Freedom design treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose applications. Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications. Note that KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not require an external video encoder. E&S programmable output features, however, will remain much more flexible. The KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system. Entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end Freedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price points. Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because it uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting in better cost/performance characteristics. Although both products provide strong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities. Denali's configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade them separately as needed. Both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at workstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive VGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide this capability. KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation of textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher qualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method. On balance, however, Denali provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications. Aside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism for texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics data storage. By implementing texture mapping on its transformation modules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels to obtain better texturing performance. Kubota avoids this problem by linking texturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable solution. Hope this helps, Brian PS This was reprinted without permission.

It also let you do some special effects(ROTATION, DITHERING ....) on image. Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different formts. Include simple file management system. Support 'slide show'. + Support 'batch conversion'. There is NO LIMIT on image size. Currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display. If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor, you must have VESA driver. If you want to modify video driver, please read section (8). (2) Hardware Requirement: PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher. min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work). (I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance). Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory). The following description is borrowed from DJGPP. Supported Wares: * Up to 128M of extended memory (expanded under VCPI) * Up to 128M of disk space used for swapping * SuperVGA 256-color mode up to 1024x768 * 80387 * XMS & VDISK memory allocation strategies * VCPI programs, such as QEMM, DESQview, and 386MAX Unsupported: * DPMI * Microsoft Windows Features: 80387 emulator, 32-bit unix-ish environment, flat memory model, SVGA graphics. (3) Installation: Video drivers, emu387 and go32.exe are borrowed from DJGPP. (If you use Western Digital VGA chips, read readme.wd) (This GO32.EXE is a modified version for vesa and is COMPLETELY compatible with original version) *** But some people report that this go32.exe is not compatible with other DJGPP programs in their system. If you encounter this problem, DON'T put go32.exe within search path. *** Please read runme.bat for how to run this program. If you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver, add 'nc 256' to environment GO32. For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grn nc 256 If you don't have 80x87, add 'emu x:/xxxxx/emu387' to environment GO32. For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grd emu x:/xxxxx/emu387 **** Notes: 1. I only test tr8900.grn, et4000.grn and vesa.grn. Other drivers are not tested. 2. I have modified et4000.grn to support 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display. You don't need to use vesa driver. If et4000.grn doesn't work, please try vesa.grn. 3. For those who want to use HiColor or TrueColor display, please use vesa.grn(except et4000 users). You can find vesa BIOS driver from : wuarchive.wustl.edu: /mirrors/msdos/graphics godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au: /kjb/MGL (4) Command Line Switch: Usage : display [-d|--display initial_display_type] [-s|--sort sort_method] [-h|-?] Display type: 8(SVGA,default), 15, 16(HiColor), 24(TrueColor) Sort method: 'name', 'ext' (5) Function Key: F2 : Change disk drive.

All Read/Write support full color(8 bits), grey scale, b/w dither, and 24 bits image, if allowed for that format. (7) Detail: Initialization: Set default display type to highest display type. Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only). 1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this menu you can press any function key. If you move or copy files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like 'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory. The header line in 'read' menu includes "(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)". d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files. pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use for reading current file. pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This program will automatically determine which format this file is. The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check standard extension. Still fail, report error. pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'. If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key (except ESCAPE). If any error occurs, program will make a beep. + 'w' or 'W' to pause, any key to continue. ESCAPE to terminate. pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type. pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting. + pressing F5 will turn on 'effect' menu. 2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu. You can do special effect on image. pressing RETURN: show image. in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text mode. pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image. pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits. pressing SPACE: save current image to file. B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit). Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits). Full Color: save as color image(8 bits). True Color: save as 24-bit image. This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change directory to what you want. Then, pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename. pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename (filename under bar). 3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display. 4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory, the performance is poor. 5. If you want to save 8 bits image : try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ... If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless): try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster (No one is better for true 24bits image) 6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images. 7. Not all subroutines are fully tested 8. This document is not well written. If you have any PROBLEM, SUGGESTION, COMMENT about this program, Please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13). I need your suggestion to improve this program. (There is NO anonymous ftp on this site) (8) Tech. information: Program (user interface and some subroutines) written by Jih-Shin Ho. Some subroutines are borrowed from XV(2.21) and PBMPLUS(dec 91). Tiff(V3.2) and Jpeg(V4) reading/writing are through public domain libraries. Compiled with DJGPP. You can get whole DJGPP package from SIMTEL20 or mirror sites. For example, wuarchive.wustl.edu: /mirrors/msdos/djgpp (9) For Thoese who want to modify video driver: 1. get GRX source code from SIMTEL20 or mirror sites. 2.

It does a much better job than the autotracing functions which are built into illustration programs. Of course, a higher resolution bitmap will produce a more accurate trace. The problem that I've run into though, is that when it creates a detailed trace, it produces WAY more points than are necessary. If I trace something manually, I use many less es points. The problem with this is it produces BIG files which slow everything down, especially printing. Chuck y	0

Lines: 16 I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that will do compositing of a series of pictures? What I mean by "compositing" is, say I have a live video clip (digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated bird flying around the screen. I want to combine these two series of pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want the living room picture to show through. Yes, I realize I can do this with a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do manual compositing also. It's ok if I have to composite one frame at a time; I assumed I'd have to do that anyway. But being able to composite a series of frames would be even better. I've looked around and I haven't found a PC package that will perform this. Help, please!	0

The quantization to 16 grays introduces some ugly bands in the pictures, which can be nicely eliminated by dithering. Up to now I have used XV to process the images, but now I would like to automate the procedure. The problem is that XV can't (I think) convert images automatically, and the obvious alternative PNMPLUS (PPMQUANT and PNMDITHER) don't even get close to XV's quality. PNMDITHER apparently dithers in RGB, even though the images are in grayscale. The dithering routine in XV seems to use the natural image colors for the dither.

It is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concave/multi outline algorithm, but not tremendously faster. I spent awhile implementing and optimizing both flavors, and the convex turned out about 10% faster. This is all C (on HP PA-RISC the compiler got the inner loop [shooting the span] as fast as possible, as far as I could tell).

I was also shocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer). This seems huge, but is only 1/256 of the dynamic range. In those terms it doesn't seem so bad. What is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due mainly to roundoff, I believe. So the polygon is not planar in z, but is more like a Ruffles potato chip. Ditto with lines. When you start/end at different x/y values, the "ridges" are out of phase, resulting in the stitch effect. You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon right on top of another, but with different vertices. You will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap. Example: Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100) Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100) Your implementation is correct. In fact, we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces with isoparametric lines. Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as you say. When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the application must do it. This is what you have discovered and are doing. Bravo!

214	From: Matjaz.Gams@IJS.si Subject: ``Call for Papers for INFORMATIKA'' Vol. 17 No. 2 Originator: abrodnik@watdragon.uwaterloo.ca Organization: Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia Lines: 69 This is an invitation to send articles to the Informatica magazine. The first fully international issue has been published and echoes are quite favourable. For any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si). Dear Colleague, April 25, 1993 Number 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you will receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structured in the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page -- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited part of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for knowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100); and news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to give you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the journal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views into the discourse. A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page expresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems within the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other concerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences, mind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology (e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this page for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get suggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express their strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the area in question. On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published. The aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional achievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on one side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which editors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should be instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live. The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have a stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular number can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation right now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your colleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the contemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated. A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh ideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities. Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.) and particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome. You can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail. On the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual reports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing in Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest. E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect. You can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete papers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received several final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US, Russia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed texts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact person (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So, you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning our common interest and job. At the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in every mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various possibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and philosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed, and on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to give proposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mail and by other means. Sincerely yours, Anton P. "Zeleznikar Editor-in-chief	0

Nntp-Posting-Host: klaatu.watson.ibm.com Organization: Visualization Systems, IBM Keywords: computer graphics, ray tracing, volume rendering --- Scientific Visualization of Chemical Systems --- Cornell Theory Center Summer School Offered through the Cornell School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions Course Description Within the past ten years, the simulation and modeling of Lines: 197 molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into a international industry. Computer graphics has played a decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to build, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects. While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their own discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology, simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists. Similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms and technological advances in graphical computing. This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of prepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended to be a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercises and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming (IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will have access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including video recording equipment.

240	From: svec5@menudo.uh.edu (T.C. Zhao) Subject: Full Color Image Editor for SGI Workstations Organization: University of Houston Lines: 159 Distribution: world NNTP-Posting-Host: menudo.uh.edu I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program, an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL. Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc, bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs, such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image. The following is the relevant sections from the man page. ----------------------------------------------------------------- Pre-Release of May, 1993 BIT(1L) NAME bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations DESCRIPTION bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both 24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner. As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The SlideShow). With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed in full without being limited by the window or screen size. As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into another. In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript). Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter- nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically giving great flexibility in processing an image. FEATURES Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, the processed image will be displayed. Current features include o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing and filling the "rotated out" region with an arbitrary color. o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with the option of subpixel sampling. o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as in TeX(1), e.g., $\alpha$\small$\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta. o Presents graphically the histogram of an image. o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation. The transformation function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai- lability of graphical histograms of the image. o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian- gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g, PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a circle). o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1- to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained. o Performs histogram equalization. o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of arbitrary order. o Crops a rectangular portion of an image. o Cuts and pastes across images. o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount. o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause interval between images. (SlideShow) o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities or as an intensity vs. distance plot. o Performs image type conversions. o Converts image formats. o Smoothes an image (Special convolution). o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image back and display it. o Modify an individual pixel's RGB values. o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the resulting power spectra. o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release). SUPPORTED FORMATS o IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS o JPEG(JFIF) format o CompuServ GIF o PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM. o XBM (X Window Bitmap) o TIFF o PostScript(Write only) Hardware requirements: --------------------------------------------------------------- Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes. Where to get it: --------------------------------------------------------------- anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z where xxx is the version number. Current version is 0.73 Read src/01Readme for installation instructions after unpacking Acknowledgement: --------------------------------------------------------------- JPEG support is based on the Independent JPEG groups's library Version 4. FORMS library, developed by Mark Overmars, is used for GUI. Both JPEG and FORMS library are included in this release. --------------------------------------------------------------- Bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate images; The built-in editing features will satisfy most of your editing needs. In addition, the external filter and dynamical kernel will utilize any program you already have. So try it (and you will like it). As always, any comments/bug reports are welcome.	0
241	From: gorgen@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com (David Gorgen) Subject: Need help: Z-buffering lines & areas together Organization: Applicon, Inc.; Ann Arbor, MI (USA) Keywords: Z-buffer, roundoff, lines, areas Lines: 84 I'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision in Z-buffering, that I've encountered in 2 different PEX implementations. I can't find any discussion of this problem in any resources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins's _PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors' documentation). I'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on comp.windows.x.pex. The problem is hard to describe without pictures, hence this article is longish. If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and are interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in comp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach to dealing with it. (It depends on the utility code from the above Gaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.) The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize "stitching" artifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas. The interpolated Z values along a line will differ slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values across an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area. Because of this, it's a tossup whether the Z-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed. Visually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the line is supposed to be solid. Using the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one for the areas and one for the lines. The PEX structures or immediate- mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines. The result is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines. This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair "backwards" (i.e. smaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas. This means that when a point is transformed to NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias. I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer, typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers). Therefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching. But in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003 to 0.006 of the range. (Empirically, it's worst when the NPC Z component of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more or less edge-on to the viewer.) It's as if only 8 or 9 bits of the Z-buffer have any dependable meaning! This amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines "show through" areas which they are supposed to lie behind. I've observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital workstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree. The test program demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation; this version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX 5.1. Open questions: (1) Why does this happen? -- Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly? -- Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which could be corrected for? -- Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their interpolators? -- Something else? (2) What to do about it? -- Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision in Z-buffered HLHSR? -- Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching artifacts? -- Am I just out of luck? Any help would be immensely appreciated! -- =============================================================================== Dave Gorgen Internet: gorgen@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com Applicon Inc. gorgen@aaaca1.sinet.slb.com Ann Arbor, Michigan (USA) UUCP: ...!uunet!sharkey!applga!gorgen	0

People seem perfectly capable dealing with these others. Dealing with the format of TIFF is frankly less difficult than dealing with the DCT, LZW, and FAX encoding of the image data. The majority of the libraries which deal with TIFF are dedicated to these other issues rather than with simply decoding the tags and parameters. Perhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather simpleminded formats such as GIF, PCX, and BMP, but to suggest that TIFF is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous. That doesn't mean that GIF isn't fine, but don't even thing about using it in many instances. GIF is very nice for use in low-end photos applications and for screen grabs and such, but it would never do for high-volume or high-resolution systems. FAX is nice, but it doesn't do color (and GIF doesn't do B&W all that well). JPEG is nice for high-resolution color, but is slow for low-end. The advantage TIFF brings to the table is its ability to handle all these situations (and then some). Naturally it's more complex. But I'ld rather propose TIFF imaging solutions over imaging systems based on having to deal with 3-4 file formats anyday. You may find that TIFF is too complicated for your personal tastes but please don't wrail against it's complexity. The complexity it contains is required to provide the functionality it does and doesn't come close to the complexity found in most commercially viable file formats. If we're in philosophical arguments against complexity, let's all go program in scheme and forth and do imaging with run length encoding.	0

Organization: University of Vienna Lines: 13 NNTP-Posting-Host: helios.edvz.univie.ac.at Hello all, I need to make some torso 3D scans and would like the phone numbers of companies in the midwest that make scans, and the numbers of companies that make the sanners (ie Cyberware). Does anyone have an idea of how much a single scan costs and the best format to save it in? I am not sure on what software platform I will be using it in, probably either Softimage or Wavefront. So I think a spline based format would be best. Please forward the numbers to me personally as I am having problems accessing USENET lately. Thanks in advance!

Well, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and was put forth by Compuserve back in 1987(?) or so. It was to create a format that could be read and displayed by any system. GIF is limited to 8 bit color but has a built in compression scheme (LZW?). IFF is not really a graphics format, but rather a standard way to package images, sounds, animations, text, or whatever into one file. IFF was created by Electronic Arts, I do believe (I could be wrong), for the Amiga. It was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga. The most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM (InterLeaved BitMap?) but many others exist. This format supports 24 bit color images. Information on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp at zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in the directory /pub/graphics.formats (Taken from the FAQ for this news group.) :) Wayne Rigby rigby@cs.unr.edu	0

We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit, and my suggestion above works perfectly with it. So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is, there must be a colormap anyway. The problems you present are exist anyway, and I didn't tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such problems to my programs in the first place. Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image as I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image back to 24 bit image. >>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How >>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global >>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and >>>much more complicated. Ok, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit and user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way, jumps off the discussion a bit. My solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit image -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly. About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image: changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image. XV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the mentioned type images. Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global changes. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like paint program job. If person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the original 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bit image, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if image is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area -- selecting individual color is possible from that. Ok, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen... >Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv? It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not designed for that. Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say, person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is expected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work -- design error. I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making major change to the original design. So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit. Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where 'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however, even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem. (Americans: the lift is just an example :) Well, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded to read it. Juhana Kouhia	0

IMHO the wider meaning is not : obsolete at all, no matter how much the lay press would like it to : be! [....] : Therefore I conclude that if you call yourself a hacker, and somebody : perceives you as a thief, then this person belongs to a very very : small group that has some computer knowledge, but not enough to know : the wider (and original) meaning of the word. [....] Unfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark recesses of the art of computing. What little they do see is from the view given to them by the media. From what I have seen from the media, 'hacker' is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person. I, on the other hand, know what 'hacker' means from those who consider themselves such. Following is the definition from "Jargon File 2.9.10". (This is also known as the "Hackers Dictionary".) The definitions are arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage: :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n. 1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. 2. One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming. 3. A person capable of appreciating {hack value}. 4. A person who is good at programming quickly. 5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in 'a UNIX hacker'. (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.) 6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy hacker, for example. 7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations. 8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around. Hence 'password hacker', 'network hacker'. See {cracker}. The term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global community defined by the net (see {network, the} and {Internet address}). It also implies that the person described is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see {hacker ethic, the}). It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe oneself that way. Hackers consider themselves something of an elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new members are gladly welcome. There is thus a certain ego satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled {bogus}). See also {wannabee}. :hacker ethic, the: n. 1. The belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible. 2. The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality. Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and giving away free software. A few go further and assert that *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU} project. Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering. But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also {samurai}). On this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop, preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}. The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing resources with other hackers. Huge cooperative networks such as {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address}) can function without central control because of this trait; they both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset. : Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is : a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large. : To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who : says "Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate..." :-) Note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing limself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better not to do so. There are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'. So, in order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary to borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the workplace. (This means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well-known and respected person.) Sometimes, there may only be one such person. : >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn't work that way. : Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-) Language works anyway that we want it to work. The purpose of language is to communicate. To oversimplify: As long as communication is taking place, then language is working. -- |================= #include <stddisclaimer.h> ================///=============| | "AMIGA: The computer for the creative mind" (tm) Commodore /// Weber State | | "Macintosh: The computer for the rest of us"(tm) Apple \\\/// University | |== "I think, therefore I AMiga" -- val@csulx.weber.edu ==\///= Ogden UT USA =|	0

274	Subject: PHIGS User Group Conference From: hamlin@ug.eds.com (Griff Hamlin) Reply-To: hamlin@ug.eds.com (Griff Hamlin) Distribution: world Organization: EDS Unigraphics, Cypress CA Nntp-Posting-Host: 134.244.15.158 Lines: 173 FIRST ANNUAL PHIGS USER GROUP CONFERENCE The First Annual PHIGS User Group Conference was held March 21-24 in Orlando, Florida. The conference was organized by the Rensse- laer Design Research Center in co-operation with IEEE and SIG- GRAPH. Attendees came from five countries spanning three con- tinents. A good cross-section of the PHIGS community was represented at this conference with participants including PHIGS users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan- dards committee members, and researchers from industry and academia. The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS users to "take charge of your PHIGS" by participating in PHIGS standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS implementors. The closing speaker, Dr. Andries Van Dam, described his vision of the future of graphics standards "beyond PHIGS". Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the following topics: PHIGS and X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues, Texture Mapping, NURBS, PHIGS Extensions, and Object-Oriented Libraries and Frameworks. Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using PHIGS, and Portability Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences. The conference also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang- ing from mathematics for 3D graphics to object-oriented tools based on PHIGS. Next year's conference is planned for March, 1994. PHIGS EVERYWHERE At the conference, PHIGS vendors described and demonstrated PHIGS products that run on all types of computers, from PCs to mainframes. Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing and translucency. Template Graphics Software launched FIGARO+ PRO, the Photo- Realistic Option for PHIGS+. FIGARO+ PRO is designed to add advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like ray tracing, materials, anti-aliasing and texture mapping. Radiosity support is also planned. FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly emerging graphics features to their products. FIGARO+ supports immediate mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL, HP Starbase and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer. TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a powerful "2-call" charting system based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object- oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers. G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS on Silicon Graphics workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver- sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company's PHIGS+ library for worksta- tions, will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS internal state. G5G also described their Non-Duplicated Data Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS CSS for more efficient use of memory. In addition, G5G described their application GSE that allows application callback functions during GPHIGS traversal. GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G's data visual- izer and application development toolkit, are currently available on all major workstations that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or Starbase. Wise Software presented a slide show of Z-PHIGS for MS-Windows and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most of the PHIGS+ primitives. In addition Z-PHIGS has built in many advanced rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera- tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of Z-PHIGS or ARENA is available on request. ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS implemen- tation based on DEC PHIGS. GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most workstation platforms with C, FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor- porates PEX support. Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center, Digital Equipment Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG. ATCs' GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS. DEC PHIGS V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with support for PEX V5.1 protocol. DEC PHIGS also contains most GM/EDS PHIGS extensions including post-to-view as well as proprietary extensions to support immediate mode rendering and the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment. AXP, DEC, and DEC PHIGS are trademarks of Digital Equipment Cor- poration. GRAFPAK-PHIGS and ATC are trademarks of Advanced Tech- nology Center. PEX and X11 are trademarks of Massachusetts Insti- tute of Technology. The IBM exhibit featured a GTO accelerator attached to an IBM 340 workstation running graPHIGS and PEX.

Once you have a gopher client point it at merlot.welch.jhu.edu and welcome to gopher-space! Dan Jacobson danj@welchgate.welch.jhu.edu ----- Common Questions and Answers about the Internet Gopher, a client/server protocol for making a world wide information service, with many implementations. Posted to comp.infosystems.gopher, comp.answers, and news.answers every two weeks. The most recent version of this FAQ can be gotten through gopher, or via anonymous ftp: rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/gopher-faq Those without FTP access should send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with "send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body to find out how to do FTP by e-mail. ------------------------------------------------------------------- List of questions in the Gopher FAQ: Q0: What is Gopher? Q1: Where can I get Gopher software? Q2: What do I need to access Gopher? Q3: Where are there publicly available logins for Gopher? Q4: Who Develops Gopher Software? Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)? Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available? Q7: What is veronica? Q8: What is Available for Biology? ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q0: What is Gopher? A0: The Internet Gopher client/server provides a distributed information delivery system around which a world/campus-wide information system (CWIS) can readily be constructed. While providing a delivery vehicle for local information, Gopher facilitates access to other Gopher and information servers throughout the world. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q1: Where can I get Gopher software? A1: via anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu. Look in the directory /pub/gopher -------------------------------------------------------------------- Q2: What do I need to access Gopher? A2: You will need a gopher "client" program that runs on your local PC or workstation There are clients for the following systems. The directory following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous ftp site boombox.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.2) in the directory /pub/gopher. Unix Curses & Emacs : /pub/gopher/Unix/gopher1.12.tar.Z Xwindows (athena) : /pub/gopher/Unix/xgopher1.2.tar.Z Xwindows (Motif) : /pub/gopher/Unix/moog Xwindows (Xview) : /pub/gopher/Unix/xvgopher Macintosh Hypercard : /pub/gopher/Macintosh-TurboGopher/old-versions * Macintosh Application : /pub/gopher/Macintosh-TurboGopher * DOS w/Clarkson Driver : /pub/gopher/PC_client/ NeXTstep : /pub/gopher/NeXT/ VM/CMS : /pub/gopher/Rice_CMS/ or /pub/gopher/VieGOPHER/ VMS : /pub/gopher/VMS/ OS/2 2.0 : /pub/gopher/os2/ MVS/XA : /pub/gopher/mvs/ Many other clients and servers have been developed by others, the following is an attempt at a comprehensive list. A Microsoft Windows Winsock client "The Gopher Book" sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-windows/winsock/goph_tbk.zip A Macintosh Application, "MacGopher". ftp.cc.utah.edu:/pub/gopher/Macintosh * Another Macintosh application, "GopherApp". ftp.bio.indiana.edu:/util/gopher/gopherapp * A port of the UNIX curses client for DOS with PC/TCP oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu:/public/dos/misc/dosgopher.exe A port of the UNIX curses client for PC-NFS bcm.tmc.edu:/nfs/gopher.exe A beta version of the PC Gopher client for Novell's LAN Workplace for DOS lennon.itn.med.umich.edu:/dos/gopher A VMS DECwindows client for use with Wollongong or UCX job.acs.ohio-state.edu:XGOPHER_CLIENT.SHARE * Note: these Macintosh clients require MacTCP. Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client itself. Put the following on a gopher server: Type=1 Host=boombox.micro.umn.edu Port=70 Path= Name=Gopher Software Distribution. Or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and look in the gopher directory. There are also a number of public telnet login sites available. The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine "consultant.micro.umn.edu" (134.84.132.4) See Q3 for more information about this. It is recommended that you run the client software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites. A client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.) A local client is also faster. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q3: Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher? A3: Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize network lag. Telnet Public Logins: Hostname IP# Login Area ------------------------- --------------- ------ ------------- consultant.micro.umn.edu 134.84.132.4 gopher North America gopher.uiuc.edu 128.174.33.160 gopher North America panda.uiowa.edu 128.255.40.201 panda North America gopher.sunet.se 192.36.125.2 gopher Europe info.anu.edu.au 150.203.84.20 info Australia gopher.chalmers.se 129.16.221.40 gopher Sweden tolten.puc.cl 146.155.1.16 gopher South America ecnet.ec 157.100.45.2 gopher Ecuador gan.ncc.go.jp 160.190.10.1 gopher Japan It is recommended that you run the client software instead of logging into the public login sites. A client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.) and gives faster response. Furthermore many of the basic features of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q4: Who Develops Gopher Software? A4: Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help our campus find answers to their computer questions. It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information System used by a large number of sites in the world. Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to count. The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail: Internet Gopher Developers 100 Union St. SE #190 Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA Or via FAX at: +1 (612) 625-6817 --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)? A5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems. As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to: - Search local WAIS indices. - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher clients. - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher clients. - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using built in gopher querying or using native http querying. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available? A6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in : _The_Whole_Internet_, Ed Kroll, O'Reilly, 1992 (Editors note: ..Great book, go out and buy a bunch!) _The_Internet_Passport: NorthWestNet's Guide to Our World Online" By Jonathan Kochmer and NorthWestNet.

A7: veronica: Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to Computerized Archives. veronica offers a keyword search of most gopher-server menu titles in the entire gopher web. As archie is to ftp archives, veronica is to gopherspace. A veronica search produces a menu of gopher items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source. Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the gopher protocol. To try veronica, select it from the "Other Gophers" menu on Minnesota's gopher server, or point your gopher at: Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace) Type=1 Port=70 Path=1/veronica Host=futique.scs.unr.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Q8: What is Available for Biology? A8: There is an incredible amount of software, data and information availble to biologists now by gopher. Here is a brief list of the Biological Databases that you can search via gopher: 2.

First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor). I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results (for better or for worse). I pulled out a copy of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I had recorded off TV a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only 5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames. I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor, keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default "2.00" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten frames. I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same "Raw Speed Test" program I used for the results I'd been reporting earlier. Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second. That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback. I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240 size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1... Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps. The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with "preferred" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback). A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task switching. A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell. I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance even more... Lawrence D'Oliveiro fone: +64-7-856-2889 Computer Services Dept fax: +64-7-838-4066 University of Waikato electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz Hamilton, New Zealand 37^ 47' 26" S, 175^ 19' 7" E, GMT+12:00 I'm afraid I missed the start of this thread, but there are three factors that can significantly affect QuickTime's playback speed that you may want to take into account: (1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a movie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16 bit, but other depths are (of course) possible). (2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for "double size" scaling, other scaling factors hit peformance much harder). (3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices to advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I'm not sure about Premiere). Any combination of those can radically alter playback performance. Image size is, of course, another biggie. Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also make a real difference.

Of course the chances of Ok It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics that you are looking for. I think you may have left out a few important parameters. The polygons are all convex. They have less than N sides. (you are drawing meshes walls doors etc.) I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave / self intersecting polygons. This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line. Complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier. The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made. Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking for code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex polygons. >finding something like that are pretty remote, so I guess I'd need the source >with it.

JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard. JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings. JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression. Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively. JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in. The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark. Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans. If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye. A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters. This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality. You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc. Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression. [2] Why use JPEG? There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data. Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images. Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time! (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one. More details below.) If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images. Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance). Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply. It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file. I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself. The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors). If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you. Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today. Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware. Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard. [3] When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF? JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both. One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to. As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material. JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do. (See section 7 for details.) GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings. In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF. JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects. This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.) JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example. Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting. Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc. The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it. Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity. The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such). Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images. It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not. If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG. You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original. If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.) However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway. This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints. Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well. [4] How well does JPEG compress images? Pretty darn well. Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor. The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B. File Size in bytes Comments ship.ppm 1145040 Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z 963829 PPM file passed through Unix compress compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note. Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif 240438 Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif Most of the savings is the result of losing color info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24. (See sec. 7.) ship.jpg95 155622 cjpeg -Q 95 (highest useful quality setting) This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75 58009 cjpeg -Q 75 (default setting) You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50 38406 cjpeg -Q 50 This has slight defects; if you know what to look for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing the original. Still as good image quality as many recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25 25192 cjpeg -Q 25 JPEG's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o 6587 cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize (-optimize cuts table overhead) Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes. Note that this file is TINY: the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 ! In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display). This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes. [5] What are good "quality" settings for JPEG? Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting. There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings. "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of the information", as some have claimed. The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything. The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original. This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb. The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice. This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image. Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up. Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality. If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation. On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info). If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right. -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art". (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it. Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale. Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just "high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.) [6] Where can I get JPEG software? Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources". (If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.) That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with "send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body. The "Anonymous FTP List FAQ" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive. NOTE: this list changes constantly. If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive. [6A] If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc: The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system. If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list. Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too. X Windows: XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other image formats. It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations. It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z. Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking. If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export. Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG. But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG. CAUTION: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry. Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks. The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software. Both of the above are large, complex packages. If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli. xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03. xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z. xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1. The next xloadimage release will fix this.) xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z. Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays. MS-DOS: This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings. One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip. This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines. The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional. Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview. The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip. Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not). Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen. For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably. Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully! A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30). This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives. Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior. It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware. (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.) The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory. (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.) A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time. The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a. However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays. Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW. Shareware, $25. Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip. Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine. If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer. (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead. VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.) The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory). These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats. Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG. The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format. Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability. Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware). Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms. Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy. This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats. It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip. NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20). Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means "pd1:<msdos.graphics>". If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20. There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead. A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics". If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how. If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is. Microsoft Windows: There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead. Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.) The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast. Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode. This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing... JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs. JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer. The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.) WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow. The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip. (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.) ColorView is another shareware entry ($30). This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG. If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip. (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.) DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window. OS/2: The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip 32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip 16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface. Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker. Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows (see description in Windows section). Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer. GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs. Has image manipulation & slideshow functions. Shareware, $20. Macintosh: Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later. (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.) You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways. With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file. However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.) Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format. (See section 10 for details.) If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format. The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format. It also can convert between the two JPEG formats. The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions. Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx. Requires System 7 and QuickTime. On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers. JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac. Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers. (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.) Some people like this behavior, some don't. Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out. GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats. The latest version is 2.3.2. Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx. Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images. Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime. (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version. JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer. Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code. If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert. Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats. You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime. PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface. Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix. (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net. If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier. Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor. Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.) Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems. (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.) You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx. You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it. If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing. If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer. More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format. Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu). You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it. Amiga: (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80). There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one. In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...) HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool. It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG. The current version is 2.0.8. A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha. The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional. Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images. The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave. The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha. (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.) Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer. The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha. If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG. Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek. These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph. Both are distributed by Great Valley Products. Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas. ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support. The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats. The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors). Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG", "VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of. In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer. Atari ST: The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats. For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering. Version 4.1 reads JPEG files. Available from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo. I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris, but surely there must be some by now? Pointers appreciated. Acorn Archimedes: !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format. Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking. Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats. While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands. Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds). There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options. This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs. Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK. Tel: 0223 841099. NeXT: ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format conversions. The current version reads JPEG but does not write it. ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are currently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specific sub-directories). Note that there is an older version floating around that does not support JPEG. Portable software for almost any system: If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B. You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files. There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day. I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow. In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product. Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files. [6B] If you are looking for source code to work with: Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead. A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9). Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z. (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.) You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip. This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.) The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers. The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays. We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability. The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join. [7] What's all this hoopla about color quantization? Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time. To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors. This process is called "color quantization". (This is something of a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term. We're stuck with the standard usage though.) Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process. It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings). Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization. This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors. Each original color gets "smeared" into a group of nearby colors. Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source. The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output. (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image. Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences. I occasionally see posted images described as "256-color JPEG". This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.) On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors. (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization. If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck. For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware. Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have. With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent. It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines. If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to. This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness. JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed. Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones! Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc. For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display. JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion. [8] How does JPEG work? The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding. This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here. For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3]. If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article. [9] What about lossless JPEG? There's a great deal of confusion on this subject. The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input. However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression. At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial. Saying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step. There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step. (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say "-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling. Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.) Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations. The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image. At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image. True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy. If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard. This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images. JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents. [10] Why all the argument about file formats? Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format. The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations. Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem. In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to "do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's. The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems. They have defined two JPEG-based file formats: * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports pixels and not much else. * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format. TIFF is a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-). TIFF is a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable, because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of TIFF. It's not likely that adding JPEG to the mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards. I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings. JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details. Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest common denominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable. A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh. QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure. Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A). If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details. Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy). These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format. By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI. This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings. Use the -j switch to get JFIF output. (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default. You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.) [11] How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it? If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format. You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file: 1. A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0, followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'. 2. If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a "raw JPEG" file. This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software --- it's worth a try, anyway. 3. HSI files start with 'hsi1'. You're out of luck unless you have HSI software. Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs. 4. A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF'). Strip off everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it. 5. Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all. If you are lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream. If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8), try stripping off everything before that. In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is "begin" line M_]C_X ... whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with "begin" line M:'-I ... If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files. [12] What about arithmetic coding? The JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file. On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding. (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.) Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies. (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.) At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles. In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet. There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future. Stay tuned for further details. [13] Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression? It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE. In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around. The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file. Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software. It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error. If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output. (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it. In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss. Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!) The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps. Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away. Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-). [14] What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG? As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG. If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that. But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality. The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary. Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well. You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF. (So check the sizes too.) Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG. They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes. Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals. To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons). Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image. While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files. It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges). Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing. (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.) cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation. (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.) Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value. The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well. The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble. Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing. With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in. Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs. Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors. (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.) Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want. If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package. However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol... The upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs. But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings. --------------------- For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net. -- tom lane organizer, Independent JPEG Group Internet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu BITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie	0

I have had >a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results. >Perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help? Certainly. Reference follows. Bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called red/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major dysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long wavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and also means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision. The other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it can also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina. It also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. Unlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than normal. On a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer graphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour deficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this point. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red corner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31 Note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly different values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental setup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical. So if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen? This problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one affected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto which all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on the spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is very similar, joining 477nm and 579nm. *So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or duuteranopia: 1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram 2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point 3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line 4) This is the new chromaticity. The best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour defective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications 8(5) 28-40. You will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not familiar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram. >I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow >previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour >blind users. Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult! Yes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and the chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or obtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a couple of weeks ago. The procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a help here.) A) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you have the monitor data. B) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v' using u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z) C) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above D) find the intersection as in step 3 E) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A F) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it along a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and white) until it is displayable. >Please email replies - I will summarise and repost if there is >sufficient interest Done; also posted for the rest of us. -- Chris Lilley ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.

Well, it beats a 32-bit design for thee sake of ellegance. 48 bit means 16 bits per primary colour. The 2^48 nr of colours is a bit misleading. It makes more sense to see it as 65536 possible shades of pure red. This might actually make some sense, since 256 shades of red (24 bit colours) may produce visible 'jumps' in intensity. Then again, a byte per primary colour for each pixel is the most elegant way of doing colour graphics, because it leaves ya such a tidy (and fast) program code.

JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard. JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings. JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression. Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively. JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in. The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark. Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans. If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye. A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters. This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality. You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc. Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression. [2] Why use JPEG? There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data. Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images. Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time! (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one. More details below.) If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images. Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance). Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply. It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file. I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself. The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors). If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you. Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today. Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware. Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard. [3] When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF? JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both. One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to. As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material. JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do. (See section 7 for details.) GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings. In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF. JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects. This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.) JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example. Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting. Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc. The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it. Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity. The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such). Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images. It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not. If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG. You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original. If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.) However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway. This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints. Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well. [4] How well does JPEG compress images? Pretty darn well. Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor. The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B. File Size in bytes Comments ship.ppm 1145040 Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z 963829 PPM file passed through Unix compress compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note. Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif 240438 Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif Most of the savings is the result of losing color info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24. (See sec. 7.) ship.jpg95 155622 cjpeg -Q 95 (highest useful quality setting) This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75 58009 cjpeg -Q 75 (default setting) You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50 38406 cjpeg -Q 50 This has slight defects; if you know what to look for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing the original. Still as good image quality as many recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25 25192 cjpeg -Q 25 JPEG's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o 6587 cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize (-optimize cuts table overhead) Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes. Note that this file is TINY: the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 ! In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display). This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes. [5] What are good "quality" settings for JPEG? Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting. There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings. "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of the information", as some have claimed. The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything. The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original. This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb. The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice. This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image. Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up. Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality. If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation. On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info). If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right. -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art". (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it. Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale. Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just "high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.) [6] Where can I get JPEG software? Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources". (If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.) That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with "send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body. The "Anonymous FTP List FAQ" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive. NOTE: this list changes constantly. If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive. [6A] If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc: The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system. If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list. Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too. X Windows: XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other image formats. It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations. It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z. Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking. If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export. Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG. But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG. CAUTION: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry. Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks. The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software. Both of the above are large, complex packages. If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli. xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03. xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z. xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1. The next xloadimage release will fix this.) xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z. Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays. MS-DOS: This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings. One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip. This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines. The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional. Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview. The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip. Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not). Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen. For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably. Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully! A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30). This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives. Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior. It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware. (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.) The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory. (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.) A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time. The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a. However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays. Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW. Shareware, $25. Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip. Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine. If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer. (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead. VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.) The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory). These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats. Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG. The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format. Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability. Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware). Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms. Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy. This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats. It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip. NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20). Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means "pd1:<msdos.graphics>". If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20. There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead. A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics". If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how. If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is. Microsoft Windows: There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead. Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.) The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast. Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode. This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing... JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs. JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer. The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.) WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow. The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip. (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.) ColorView is another shareware entry ($30). This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG. If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip. (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.) DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window. OS/2: The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip 32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip 16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface. Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker. Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows (see description in Windows section). Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer. GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed as the above programs. Strong 24-bit display support. Shareware, $20. Macintosh: Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later. (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.) You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways. With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file. However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.) Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format. (See section 10 for details.) If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format. The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format. It also can convert between the two JPEG formats. The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions. Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx. Requires System 7 and QuickTime. On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers. JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac. Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers. (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.) Some people like this behavior, some don't. Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out. GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats. The latest version is 2.3.2. Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx. Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images. Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime. (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version. JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer. Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code. If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert. Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats. You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime. PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface. Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix. (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net. If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier. Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor. Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.) Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems. (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.) You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx. You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it. If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing. If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer. More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format. Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu). You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it. Amiga: (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80). There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one. In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...) HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool. It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG. The current version is 2.0.8. A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha. The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional. Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images. The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave. The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha. (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.) Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer. The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha. If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG. Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek. These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph. Both are distributed by Great Valley Products. Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas. ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support. The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats. The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors). Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG", "VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of. In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer. Atari ST: The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats. For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering. Version 4.1 reads JPEG files. Available from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo. I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris, but surely there must be some by now? Pointers appreciated. Acorn Archimedes: !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format. Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking. Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats. While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands. Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds). There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options. This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs. Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK. Tel: 0223 841099. Portable software for almost any system: If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B. You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files. There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day. I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow. In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product. Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files. [6B] If you are looking for source code to work with: Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead. A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9). Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z. (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.) You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip. This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.) The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers. The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays. We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability. The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join. [7] What's all this hoopla about color quantization? Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time. To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors. This process is called "color quantization". (This is something of a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term. We're stuck with the standard usage though.) Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process. It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings). Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization. This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors. Each original color gets "smeared" into a group of nearby colors. Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source. The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output. (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image. Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences. I occasionally see posted images described as "256-color JPEG". This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.) On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors. (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization. If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck. For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware. Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have. With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent. It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines. If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to. This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness. JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed. Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones! Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc. For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display. JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion. [8] How does JPEG work? The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding. This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here. For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3]. If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article. [9] What about lossless JPEG? There's a great deal of confusion on this subject. The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input. However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression. At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial. Saying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step. There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step. (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say "-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling. Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.) Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations. The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image. At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image. True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy. If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard. This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images. JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents. [10] Why all the argument about file formats? Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format. The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations. Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem. In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to "do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's. The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems. They have defined two JPEG-based file formats: * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports pixels and not much else. * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format. TIFF is a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-). TIFF is a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable, because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of TIFF. It's not likely that adding JPEG to the mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards. I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings. JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details. Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest common denominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable. A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh. QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure. Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A). If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details. Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy). These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format. By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI. This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings. Use the -j switch to get JFIF output. (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default. You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.) [11] How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it? If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format. You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file: 1. A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0, followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'. 2. If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a "raw JPEG" file. This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software --- it's worth a try, anyway. 3. HSI files start with 'hsi1'. You're out of luck unless you have HSI software. Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs. 4. A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF'). Strip off everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it. 5. Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all. If you are lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream. If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8), try stripping off everything before that. In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is "begin" line M_]C_X ... whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with "begin" line M:'-I ... If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files. [12] What about arithmetic coding? The JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file. On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding. (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.) Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies. (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.) At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles. In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet. There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future. Stay tuned for further details. [13] Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression? It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE. In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around. The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file. Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software. It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error. If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output. (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it. In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss. Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!) The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps. Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away. Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-). [14] What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG? As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG. If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that. But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality. The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary. Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well. You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF. (So check the sizes too.) Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG. They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes. Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals. To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons). Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image. While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files. It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges). Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing. (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.) cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation. (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.) Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value. The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well. The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble. Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing. With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in. Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs. Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors. (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.) Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want. If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package. However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol... The upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs. But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings. --------------------- For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net. -- tom lane organizer, Independent JPEG Group Internet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu BITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie	0

SYNERGY: Revolt ...the first in a continuing series of collaborative art initiatives designed to exploit the binarity of the infosphere. This series of diversely structured art-manipulation projects will attempt to stretch across network boundries encouraging use of electronic mail, fax, video, photography, scanned "conventional" art and even sound to create multi-artist "still" visuals in GIF and JPG formats. Visualists from all technical levels are welcome. REVOLT will be structured simply. There will be three stages of production. The first stage will consist of all participants creating one still work as a "starter" piece that two other partici- pants will, in turn, manipulate. All first stage "base" images are due by Sunday, May 23rd, 1993, midnight Central Daylight Time. Stage two will begin on May 24th. All images will be sent to another (arbitrarily chosen) participant for them to do manipulations on in anyway they see fit. For purely digital artists, this may consist of filtering the image through their favorite paint program. For "analog" artists, this may well be printing a hardcopy of the image and adding their own part with pen, pencil or white-out then scan- ning in the image again to be transferred on to the third-stage artist. All second-stage works are due by midnight on Sunday, May 30th. Stage three is the finishing stage and will begin on May 31st. All artists will do what they think it takes to finish up the image they've been given using whatever technique they see as worthy. These images will be due on June 6th, midnight. All involved will participate in each stage of creation. ----------------------------------------------------------- To join, send email/mail with the following info: Name: email address: mail address: scanner access?

I haven't actually used one or seen one, so take the specs with a grain of salt. I'd like to see an independent review of one against, say, an SGI Indigo Extreme or something. Basically, the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations that run OSF/1 ( DEC's ) and will likely run Windows NT in the future. They are binary compatible with Digital's OSF/1 Alpha AXP implementation. Denali is their graphics subsystem, which is upgradable in the field by simply adding "transformation engines". The two main Kenai machines are the 3400 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation and the 3500 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation. 3400 3500 CPU DEC Alpha AXP 133MHz DEC Alpha AXP 150MHz On-chip cache 8k/8k 8k/8k Onboard cache 512K 512K Word Size 64-bit 64-bit Memory ( initial ) 32-128MB 32-256MB Memory ( future ) 512MB 1GB SPECMARK89 111 126 SPECINT92 75 84 SPECFP92 112 128 GRAPHICS Transform Modules 1-6 1-6 Frame Buffer Modules 5,10,20 5,10,20 Frame Buffer 1280x1024x24bit 1280x1024x24bit double buffered double buffered Z-buffer 24-bit 24-bit Alpha/stencil 8-bit 8-bit Stereo support yes yes Other: both machines will double buffer or do stereo output per window.

The Kenai stations work with a graphics architecture known as Denali. The Denali comes in three models, the E, P, and V. They use a DECchip 21064 superscalar RISC processor at 150MHz. Their capabilities are as follows: E P V 2D Vectors 800-200K 2000-3800K 4000-4800K 3D Vectors #1 350-1100K 1100-1800K 1800-2100K 3D Vectors #2 300-1000K 1000-1600K 1600-1900K 3D Vectors #3 300-500K 800-1000K 1300-1400K 3D Triangles, #4 200-500K 600-1000K 1000-1200K 3D Triangles, #5 100-200K 300-400K 500-600K #1: 10 pixel, flat shaded, connected #2: 10 pixel, Gouraud shaded, connected #3: 10 pixel, 2-pixel wide, anti-aliased, connected #4: 50-pixel, Gouraud shaded, Z-buffered, strip #5: 50-pixel, texture mapped, persp., point sampled IMAGE PROCESSING Cine loop - 8-bit 15-36Mp/s 37-58 Mp/s 60-68 Mp/s Cine loop - 16-bit 14 Mp/s 25 Mp/s 38 Mp/s Cine loop - 24-bit 12-21 Mp/s 21 Mp/s 21 Mp/s Contrast stretching #1 14 Mp/s 25 Mp/s 20 Mp/s Bilinear zoom 6 Mp/s 11 Mp/s 20 Mp/s Trilinear interp#2 -- 6 Mvoxels/s 11 Mvoxels/s #1: Lookup table -- 12-,16-bit to 8 #2: Trilinear interpolation, 8-bit voxels CONFIGURATIONS Frame Buffer Modules 5 10 20 Transform Engine Mod. 1-3 3-5 5-6 As you can see, these are pretty powerful workstations, and the best part is the pricing. I would recommend that you call Kubota for more information. Their number is 408-727-8100. I'm sure they'll send you an information you may want. Oh, some prices: Low-end Kenai 3400, E Series w/ 1 TEM and 5 FBM --- 27,795 dollars U.S. Kenai 3500, E Series w/ 1 TEM and 5 FBM --- 45,345 dollars U.S. High-end Kenai 3400, V Series w/ 6 TEM and 20 FBM -- 61,795 dollars U.S. Kenai 3500, V Series w/ 6 TEM and 20 FBM -- 79,345 dollars U.S. If someone could post a relative comparision with an Indigo Extreme or something I would appreciate it.

I suspect I'll implement the display controller as a server process that handles graphics requests, queued on a mailbox, one at a time. If this provides sufficiently frequent display updates then I believe that I can restrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need for a reentrant graphics library.

This I appreciated very much . I would however like to know why it is that ther is simply NO information out there on some subjects for the relativly novice graphics programmer. The subjects are 1) How do you access the extra video memory on a video board. I know somwhere there aresome standard video bios calls that allow you to dothis. I have 1meg of memory on my board and according to all the books and info I have read I am only (at maximum) using 256k of it. There is a way to do this in standard VGA cause I have seen vidoe paging (written in assembly, which I don't know) written into apps hat use mode 13h. To get any speed at all you have to do this. How do I do it? 2) The vesa standard. What gives here. I have read most of what the net has to offer on VESA and as far as coding for VESA goes most of the advice is cryptic at best. Where do I get public domain info that will tell me in "mostly plain" english how the vesa calls work. My biggest gripe is about number 1. I have bought graphics books, I have asked graphics professors, I have hunted the net through both gopher, and archie, I ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is some lock on this information. Graphics programming books tell alot of programmiing algorithm information, but they always fall short of telling you how to really control the video bios. What are all the calls folks, I know there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff. Where are you, and why haven't you written a book yet?

Their latest model, the RAID 5 model Gen 4 only does 90 MB/sec. but I think this may be a limitation only of the HiPPI channel and that customer needs have not exceeded that speed since their older model was faster. They are also not idle (must be working on newer products that might be faster) and are a small company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces. They still marketed the older, faster model as of a few mongths ago.

The first and only thing I've ever tried to auto-trace was a piece of a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2. I wanted to get the outline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound. I was simultaneously suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did. I suspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing; not only is the coastline very irregular, but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines (not only lattitude and longitude, but loran grids as well). The most common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and tangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead of the coast. I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive algorithm that would let you step in and say "no, dummy, you're going the wrong way". Steve Reisberg, a friend of mine a few years back(*), did his doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii). A good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles. This is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with its auto-trace tool. In some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder, since he was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a good centerline was only the first step, but a step on which all future analysis depended. However, in other respects, it was an easier problem since the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the virus particles were supposed to look like, and the analysis could be restricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight, clean, and well imaged; you don't always have that freedom auto-tracing real life images. In any case, it gave me some insight into just how difficult this problem is to solve in the general case. (*) Steve is no longer with us. He and his wife disappeared while on vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated. Their last known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area. While no bodies were ever found, they are presumed to have been the victim of some sort of fall or accident in the woods. -- Roy Smith <roy@nyu.edu> Hippocrates Project, Department of Microbiology, Coles 202 NYU School of Medicine, 550 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016 "This never happened to Bart Simpson."	0

What i want to do is the following; From a fast source, eg. a CDROM, several sound sources are read, each having it's own defined position and other attributes, eg. direction etc. Given the listeners position and direction, the sum of sound played back in each of the listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction. This means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's incoming direction have to be done for each sound source. (I think this is possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles relative to each ear, and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given angle. This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the source. This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source changes position or the listener changes orientation.) Additionally some reflection, diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined could be simulated, but this requires some sort of sound propagandation simulation, kinda like some radiosity algorithm. Have someone done this and/or written articles on implementing such a system?

Thanks. I get regular questions about gamma correction since I go to great pains to deal with it properly in xli (the image loader program I maintain). Here is an explanation I often use to answer these questions. This might be suitable for inclusion in the FAQ. Graeme Gill. ########################################################################### "A note on gamma correction and images" Author: Graeme W. Gill graeme@labtam.oz.au Date: 93/5/16 "What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?" -------------------------------------- Although it would be nice to think that "an image is an image", there are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of different image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit complicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you've ever downloaded images from BBS or the net, you've probably noticed (with most image viewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some look too light. "Why is this ?" you may ask. This, is gamma correction (or the lack of it). Why do we need gamma correction at all ? -------------------------------------- Gamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode ray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of the scene, then you have created a "linear" or un-gamma-corrected image. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate the image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world). Now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage and feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn't_ give you an amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage something like this: Light_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma So if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image will look much too dark. To fix this up you have to "gamma correct" the image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT will do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get what you want. So you have to do this to your image: gamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma) For most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0. If that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ? ----------------------------------------------------- The problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction. Also not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras or video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images already have some gamma correction done to them, and you are rarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images with a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets corrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those images with a program that doesn't do gamma correction, then it will look vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is not exactly right for you particular CRT. Whose fault is all this ? ----------------------- It is really three things. One is all those display programs out there that don't do gamma correction properly. Another is that most image formats don't specify a standard gamma, or don't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is. The third thing is that not many people understand what gamma correction is all about, and create a lot of images with varying gamma's. At least two file formats do the right thing. The Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording the gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression) specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a linear image - but not everyone obeys the rules). Some image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility) allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you are using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to view. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and utilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma of an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction yourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has, and then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor. [ Note that xv 2.21 doesn't provide an easy way of modifying the gamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the appropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity in the HSV controls doesn't do the right thing, as it fails to take account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends to give a tint to the image. ] How can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ? --------------------------------------------------------------------- The simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg (provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file containing two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear to the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using dithering. If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects images, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half way from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if you move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a bit.) If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have a long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness will be above the center. If your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction for a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the gamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be around 2.2 [with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the -dispgamma flag, and once you've got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA environment variable in your .profile] How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ? ------------------------------------------------- This is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of true color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of 1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma correction. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images (ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected to some degree or other. If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will look good, and gamma corrected images will look too light. If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then linear images will look too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok. Why Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing ----------------------------------------------------- One of the reason that many high quality formats (such as Video) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better use of the storage medium. This is because the human eye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction has a similar compression characteristic. This means images could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance), if they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that every time you want to do any image processing you should convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain the same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard gamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected images at the popular level. If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma, and if image manipulation software takes care to use extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data, then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing. (I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image). ###########################################################################	0

I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel of 12 bits for computational precision. More than that would seem to be wasted. Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to represent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding. Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component) frame buffers. This set up, called double buffering, allows a complex 3d picture to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previous frame) is displayed. This makes for smoother animation. >(sadly, I have access to none of them. Just a DEC 5000/25. Sigh.) Well hey if you want to brag about numbers, the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+ card with 96 bits per pixel. Full double buffering (Two 24 bit buffers), a 24 bit Z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage. Mind you the card costs more than your workstation. -- Chris Lilley ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.

358	From: ewinterr@cwis.isu.edu (EWING_TERRY) Subject: Raytriacing and animation Organization: Idaho State University, Pocatello Lines: 14 NNTP-Posting-Host: cwis.isu.edu Now I have a couple raytracing questions. Just so you know I'm using PovRay 1.0 (both MS-dos and Unix) and I'm generating Targa files of varying size. 1) ok, so I can view these wonderful pictures on my screen. What's the best way to get them on to paper? Would it be possible to take it to Kinko's and have them make an actual picture on paper from it? 2) I was thinking about making a small animation bit with different raytraced frames. Is this a bad idea? Any tricks to it? 3 ) How would I get a sequence of targa files made into an animation that I could put on a videotape? Is there a cheap way?	0

CIA World Map II ---------------- [ NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured. If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ] Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above) The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360 array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for every half degree longitude and latitude. A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11). There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>. The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it. (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package. NCAR data --------- NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of terrain data, ranging from elevation datasets at various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc. This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape, IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available). Their data archive is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented. For more information, email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu. UNC data tapes with voxel data -------------- There are 2 "public domain" tapes with data for the comparison and testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill. (softlab@cs.unc.edu) The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD NASA ---- Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data from various space missions, eg.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles ========================================= First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above. 24-bit scanning: ---------------- Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 : scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll house supplies. So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area. Books with textures: -------------------- Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material. Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also a wide variety of stock art is available. Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock, UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available. In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your graphics work. Their address is: Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd., 00196 Rome Italy, Piazzale Flaminio, 19 Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06) 360-29-60 Texture Libraries: ------------------ a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.

For more info contact: Essence Info Apex Software Publishing 405 El Camino Real Suite 121 Menlo Park CA 94025 USA [ What about Texture City ?? ] ========================================================================== 14. Introduction to rendering algorithms ======================================== a. Ray-Tracing: --------------- I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would suggest: An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press 1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4 Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines (erich@eye.com) There's a more concise reference also: Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: "An Introduction to Ray Tracing", in "Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw, NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988. It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer. b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) -------------------------- A good reference is: _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284. c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ] ======================================================================== 15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================ a. Teapot ? ----------- "Displays on Display" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot. IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column "Jim Blinn's Corner" describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used. The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself. The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution. b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------ Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list): model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2) 406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown. Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it. model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu , /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data model3: The triangles' model. This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model. Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy. He did not mention any restriction on the model's distribution. model4: The NASA model. The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations: <x offset> <y offset> <z offset> From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions 3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex, 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex, 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches. Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown model5: The old shuttle model. The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions. 104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters. We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy. ======================================================================== 16. Image annotation software ============================= a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good. It reads in rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a rasterfile. b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool. I'm not sure exactly what they are. You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu. c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm) and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats. If the image you have is in formats other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm. Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9) d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below). This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package. e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus. pbmtext gives you text output bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image. f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z, pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1). A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for SPARC systems is also available for ftp. All software is the property of Columbia University and may not be redistributed without permission. ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing. g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server. Pick the position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen color from a pull-down menu. ImageMagick can read and write many of the more popular image formats. ImageMagick is available as export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest X11 archive. ======================================================================== 17. Scientific visualization stuff ================================== X Data Slice (xds) ------------------- Bundled with the X11 distribution from MIT, in the contrib directory. Available at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu [141.142.20.50] (either as a source or binaries for various platforms).

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge, synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies. WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working for Alex Goetz. You might try contacting them if you already have IDL or would be willing to buy it. It's a few thousand dollars (American) I expect for IDL and the other should be free. Those are the general purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has. SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery. I'm not sure how general purpose it is. You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask. I have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image modification (you can compute an image using selected components). I've used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best speed you need an external DSP card. It will work without it, but large images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process. That's a freebie if you want it" "My favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems, Inc. IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement, cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars, menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other Motif widgets. FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. FVS is designed to accept data generated from these simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these data graphically. FVS accepts three-dimensional multi-block data recorded in NCSA HDF format. iti.gov.sg [192.122.132.130] : /pub/svlib (Scientific Visualization) /pu/fvs; These directories contain demo binaries for Sun4/SGI Cost : US$200 for academic and US$300 for non-academic institutions.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) =================================================== GRASS ----- (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package, although it is reported to have significant image processing capabilities. Feature Descriptions I use GRASS because it's public domain and can be obtained through the internet for free. GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C. The source code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass Integration. You then compile the source code for your machine, using scripts provided with GRASS. I would recommend GRASS for someone who already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software." A first review of overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS . This gentleman has used the GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective interface. Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68 Host Configuration Requirements If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS on a Macintosh which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for satellite data. GRASS is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability, and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented in raster (grid-cell) form. Availability CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI) maintains an ftp server: moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254). Mail regarding this site should be addressed to grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil. This location will be the new "canonical" source for GRASS software, as well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files. This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and "tar" archiving of files. A feature attraction of the server is John Parks' GRASS tutorial. Because the manual is still in beta-test stage, John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu Support Listserv mailing lists: grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil. grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil. Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists, we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass through the list. If you have questions, problems, or comments, send E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond. Microstation Imager ------------------- Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS software/hardware. Microstation is a base graphics package that Imager sits on top of. Imager is basically an image processing package with a heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor. Feature Description Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine. Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image). RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion. Principal component analysis. Classification: K-means and isodata. Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering and reverse. Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median, generic. Complex Histogram/Contrast control. Layer Controller: manages up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc. The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available for GIS applications. Host Configuration Requirements It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun) though there were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software would be ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment. PCI --- A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of remote sensing data in eight or ten different "industry standard" formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I forget. The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly other platforms by now. I use the VMS version. The "PCI software" consists of several classes/groups/packages of utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common "PCI database" disk file. The "Tape I/O" package is a set of utility programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the "PCI database" file; this is the only package I use or know much about. Other packages can display data from the PCI database to one or another of several PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type dot-matrix graphics printer. You might be more spe- cifically interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g. "multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5"), and God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT. I don't have and don't use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your particular application/interest calls for. Each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from a common "parameter file" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your "default directory." Some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of operations. The standard PCI environment contains a scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated, lengthy or difficult series of utility executions. (In VMS I can also invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.) There's also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI data structures (database file, parameter file). The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle a few other things as well. For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the Macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different "interleave" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the graphic-arts industry's "CT2T" format, would probably (I haven't tried) handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start over. It's worth noting that the PCI "database" file is designed to contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude, longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this can go into the PCI "database"). I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used. On VAX systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to mind). One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would display directly from a PCI "database" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus 24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem. PCI software COULD be "overkill" in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end" applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time). It's probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these areas. SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) -------------------------------- Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time. That was designed for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer) which uses much larger images. Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays). Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement (stretching). Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering. The original Spam uses X or SunView to display. The AVIRIS version may require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame buffer. I can refer you to people if you're interested. PCW requires X for display. MAP II ------ Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley. CLRview ------- CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers. This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources. It supports the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF, TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others. CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.

The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8 bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these modifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a 32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry. Having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly? Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to each colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range 0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries. You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how far each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look rather odd. So in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds: >>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How >>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global >>changes could be done unless the software were very different and >>much more complicated. >>If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much >>more powerfull software - which is readily available commercially. In other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job. Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves. As to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV. If that was not what you meant, then: >(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many >places so far.) Yes, I probably did. I found that the collected digest format of your posting made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was.

Also, users can send the authors feedback, to report text errors and software bugs, make suggestions, and submit exercises. To receive information describing how you can use the mail handler, simply mail graphtext@cs.brown.edu and put the word "Help" in the Subject line. Use the Subject line "Software-Distribution" to receive information specifically concerning the software packages SRGP and SPHIGS. Errata for "An Introduction to Ray Tracing" is available on wuarchive.wustl.edu in graphics/graphics/books/IntroToRT.errata. Errata for "Digital Image Warping" is in the same directory as "Digital-Image-Warping.errata". All C code from the "Graphics Gems" series is available via anonymous ftp from princeton.edu. Look in the directory pub/Graphics/GraphicsGems for the various volumes (Gems, GemsII, GemsIII), and get the README file first. Errata to _Graphics Gems_ and _Graphics Gems II is available on wuarchive.wustl.edu in graphics/graphics/books. A list of computer graphics, computational geometry and image processing journals is available from Juhana Kouhia, jk87377@cs.tut.fi. 2) Drawing three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional screen. The simple answer is, you divide by the depth. For a more verbose explanation, see any of the above references, starting with: The Foley & Van Dam & Feiner & Hughes "Computer Graphics" book is certainly a good start. Chapter 6 is "Viewing in 3D", then read chapter 15, "Visible-Surface Determination". For more information go to chapter 16 for shading, chapter 19 for clipping, and branch out from there. 3) Quantizing 24 bit images down to 8 bits. Find a copy of "Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display" by Paul Heckbert, SIGGRAPH '82 Proceedings, page 297. There are other algorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple. Implementations are included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below). A variant method is described in "Graphics Gems", p. 287-293. Note that the code from the "Graphics Gems" series is all available from an FTP site, as described above. Check out John Bradley's "Diversity Algorithm", which is incorporated into the xv package and described in the back of the manual. The ImageMagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another quantizing algorithm which is presented as "doing a better job than the other algorithms, but slower". There's also an implementation of: Wan, Wong, and Prusinkiewicz, _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data Clustering_, Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 14 #2 (June, 1988), pp. 153-162. avialable as princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar. This code, in modified form, appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well. 4) Converting color into grayscale. The NTSC formula is: luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue 5) Quantizing grayscale to black&white. The only reference you need for this stuff is: Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press 1987, ISBN 0-262-21009-6 But before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulation software mentioned in item 7 below. All of the packages mentioned can do some form of gray to b&w conversion. 6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle. The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination. This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination. Instead, loop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse* transformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source. This method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one 2-D mapping, not just rotation. You can add anti-aliasing by doing sub-pixel sampling. However, there is a much faster method, with antialising included, which involves doing three shear operations. The method was originally created for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation is also present in PBMPLUS. Reference: "A Fast Algorithm for Raster Rotation", by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics Interface '86 (Vancouver). An article on the IM toolkit appears in the same journal. An updated version of the rotation paper appears in "Graphics Gems" (see section [1]) under the original title. 7) Free image manipulation software. There are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to another, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus the above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions. Here are pointers to some of them: xv by John Bradley. X-based image display, manipulation, and format conversion package. XV displays many image formats and permits editing of GIF files, among others. The program was updated 5/92; see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu. PBMPLUS, by Jef Poskanzer. Comprehensive format conversion and image manipulation package. The latest version is always available via anonymous FTP as ftp.ee.lbl.gov:pbmplus*.tar.Z, wuarchive.wustl.edu:graphics/graphics/packages/pbmplus/pbmplus*.tar.Z, and export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/pbmplus*.tar.Z. IM Raster Toolkit, by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.uwaterloo.ca). Provides a portable and efficient format and related toolkit.

It supports images in 1, 8, 24 and 32 bit formats. Reads/writes and converts to/from GIF, xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, and other formats. Writes level 2 postscript. Other utilities and image application library are included. Not a paint package. Available via ftp from gis.mit.edu. xloadimage, by Jim Frost <madd@std.com>. Reads in images in various formats and displays them on an X11 screen. Available via FTP as export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xloadimage*, and in your nearest comp.sources.x archive. xli, by Grame Gill, is an updated xloadimage with numerous improvements in both speed and in the number of formats supported. Available in the same places as xloadimage (contrib tape, comp.sources.x archives). TIFF Software, by Sam Leffler <sam@okeeffe.berkeley.edu>. Nice portable library for reading and writing TIFF files, plus a few tools for manipulating them and reading other formats. Available via FTP as ucbvax.berkeley.edu:pub/tiff/*.tar.Z or ftp.uu.net:graphics/tiff.tar.Z xtiff, an X11 tool for viewing a TIFF file. It was written to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining simple, portable and efficient. xtiff illustrates some common problems with building pixmaps and using different visual classes. It is distributed as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu, ftp.uu.net and comp.sources.x. xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.

There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message. See item 13 below for details on some. Also, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion of software like this. You may find useful information there. 8) Format documents for TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc. You almost certainly don't need these. Read the above item 7 on free image manipulation software. Get one or more of these packages and look through them. Chances are excellent that the image converter you were going to write is already there. But if you still want one of the format documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats. These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct. This archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional object formats. The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as Mark Hall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it. A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained by Quincey Koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu). The latest version exists at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats. Apparently, neither of these is complete, you might want to check both. FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. It's a file format most often used in astronomy. Despite the name, it can contain not only images but other things as well. There is a regular monthly FITS basics and information posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more. 9) Converting between vector formats. A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDraw to CGM, or whatever. It is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item 7. Converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you get past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects are the same for all image formats. This is not so for vector formats. The basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled round-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another. Except in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do a one-to-one conversion between vector formats. There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu. The contributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac. A better, more specific blurb would be most welcome. On the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation, rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another. As far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been posted to comp.sources.misc. Check the index on your nearest archive site. A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to X11 bitmap. For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for PC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer. Also, the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's X11/NeWs can be used to render to a file if you're clever. But in general, the answer is no. However, if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial. GNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as a PostScript to ppm or a PostScript to GIF filter. (It implements essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript and level 2). 10) How to get Pixar films.

They will take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card. I ordered mine just last week and received it several days later. Don't expect to be able to rent a copy from your local video store. According to the license agreement printed on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rented. 11) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier (or B-spline) curve? The short answer is, "You can't." Unless you use a rational spline you can only approximate a circle. The approximation may look acceptable, but it is sensitive to scale. Magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnifies. Deviations from circularity that were not visible in the small can become glaring in the large. If you want to do the job right, consult the article: "A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles" by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9, September, 1989, pages 48-56. For rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book: Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt, Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980. For the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article: "Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves" by Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, and Knut Morken in Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined), June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)] 12) How to order standards documents. The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and also ISO (international) standards. Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900, mailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018. It helps if you have the complete name and number. Some useful numbers to know: CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987). GKS (Graphical Kernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985. PHIGS (Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988. IGES is ASME/ANSI Y14.26M-1987. Language bindings are often separate but related numbers; for example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985. Standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit comments from the graphical public (this includes you!). ANSI can let you know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering at 1-800-854-7179. 13) How to FTP by email. There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system. You send a message to an automated server saying something like "send comp.sources.unix/fbm", and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail. In addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server. Send mail to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying "help" and it will tell you how to use it. Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse. 14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon. Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity. If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way, the point is within the polygon. If the ray crosses an even number of edges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges. This idea is known in the trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines' article in Glassner's ray tracing book (above) for more information, including treatment of special cases. Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon. If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside, if the sum is 0 the point is outside. However, this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly. Code for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in the Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu: pub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z. 15) How to tessellate a sphere. One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles. The base of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides each triangle into four smaller ones. Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu> has posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates. It's available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu. 16) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination. Rick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography: Highlights of this edition- i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through November '91; ii) papers from all Siggraph, Graphics Interface, Eurographics, CG International and Ausgraph proceedings through December, '91; iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup; iv) cross-indices by keyword and author; v) glossary of the 119 keywords used. The bib is in the form of a PostScript file. The printout is 41 pages long. Below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file. It's named "speer.raytrace.bib.ps.Z" and is compressed at most sites- Site Dir wuarchive.wustl.edu graphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/ karazm.math.uh.edu pub/Graphics/ gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au pub/papers/ nic.funet.fi pub/sci/papers/graphics coral.cs.jcu.edu.au graphics/papers/ Eric Haines (erich@eye.com) maintains ray tracing and radiosity/global illumination bibliographies. These are in "refer" format, and so can be searched electronically (a simple awk script to search for keywords is included with each). The bibliographies are available at most of the sites listed above, and the most current versions are maintained at princeton.edu: pub/Graphics/Papers as "RayBib.*" and "RadBib.*". Tom Wilson (wilson@cs.ucf.edu) has collected over 300 abstracts from ray tracing related research papers and books. The information is essentially in plaintext, and Latex and troff formatting programs are included. This collection is available at most of the sites above as "rtabs.*". 17) SIGGRAPH information online [from Steve Cunningham and Ralph Orlick] ACM-SIGGRAPH announces its online information site at siggraph.org (128.248.245.250). This site now provides SIGGRAPH information via both anonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server. The anonymous ftp service is very standard, and the ftp directory includes both conference and publications subdirectories. To retrieve information by electronic mail, send mail to archive-server@siggraph.org and in the subject or the body of the message include the message send followed by the topic and subtopic you wish. A good place to start is with the command send index which will give you an up-to-date list of available information. 18) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available [from Steve Cunningham and Bob Judd] ACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of the SIGGRAPH '91 Panels Proceedings at the siggraph.org site (128.248.245.250). The proceedings are available in three formats: text (ASCII) rtf (rich text format, suitable for many word processors) word (MS Word for the Macintosh) They may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways: (1) by anonymous ftp change to one of the directories publications/s91/panels_proceedings/[text|rtf|word] The text and rtf files may be downloaded in ASCII mode, while the word files are stored in MacBinary format and must be downloaded in binary mode. Each directory contains a Table of Contents file (TOC) that describes the contents of each panel file. (2) by electronic mail send mail to archive-server@siggraph.org You can retrieve either the text or rtf files. We suggest that you first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages send panel91-txt index send panel91-rtf index in the subject or body of the message. You will get the necessary information to retrieve the actual transcript files. 19) Graphics mailing lists There are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there, each covering either a single product or a single topic. I have been an active participant in one of these for some time now, and find the focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic to be nothing short of amazing. Please send me the appropriate information if you have any others you would like to see added.

Comments - 26 formats, no software (this is good, IMHO - I prefer books which are non-platform-dependent). Questions about this book may be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us. 21) What about GIF? GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format. It is portable and usable upon a wide variety of platforms. It is quite limited in some ways (yes, the keeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I don't like it much. However, it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question which was not previously covered in this list. The following is a list of newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF. Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info Newsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.d,alt.binaries.pictures.misc, alt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals, alt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answers Available in the indicated USENET newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp from pit-manager.mit.edu in the files: /pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 /pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2 Also available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail message containing any or all of: send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2 Send a message containing "help" to get general information about the mail server. Also, you could check out the resources described in sections 7, 8, and 20 above for more information. 22) What is morphing? Warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new location. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one. Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and morphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au in the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files: morph_intro.ps.Z (PostScript version, many pictures - 1.5M) morph_intro.txt.Z (text version) m_responses.Z (Responses to morphing questions) The files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and uncompress them afterwards. 23) How to ray-trace height fields Height fields are a special case in ray-tracing. They have a number of uses, such as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible. Thus, they get their own FAQ section. Note that further references can no doubt be located via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above. The following paper seems to be the definitive reference: F. Kenton Musgrave Grid Tracing: Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields July, 1988 <musg88.ps.Z> This is available as "Research Report YALEU/DCS/RR-639" from Yale University, it's also in the SIGGRAPH '91 Fractal Modeling in 3D Computer Graphics and Imaging course notes, and (best of all) it's available on the net: nic.funet.fi pub/sci/papers/musg88.ps.Z weedeater.math.yale.edu pub/Papers/musg88.ms.Z princeton.edu pub/Graphics/Papers/musg88.ms.Z coral.cs.jcu.edu.au graphics/papers/musg88.ps.Z gondwana.ecr.mu.OZ.AU pub/papers/musg88.ms.Z and musg88.ps.Z An implementation of this paper may be found in Rayshade. Another paper exists: %A David W. Paglieroni %A Sidney M. Petersen %T Parametric Height Field Ray Tracing %J Proceedings of Graphics Interface '92 %I Canadian Information Processing Society %C Toronto, Ontario %D May 1992 %P 192-200 And still one more: Musgrave, Kolb, and Mace "The Synthesis and Rendering of Eroded Fractal Terrains", Computer Graphics Vol 23, No. 3 (SIGGRAPH '89 procedings) p. 41-50 24) How to find the area of a 3D polygon The area of a triangle is given by (in C notation), area = 0.5 * ( ( x[0] * y[1] ) + ( x[1] * y[2] ) + ( x[2] * y[0] ) - ( x[1] * y[0] ) - ( x[2] * y[1] ) - ( x[0] * y[2] ) ); and the area of a planar polygon is given by area = 0.0; for ( i = 0; i < n - 1; i++ ) area += ( x[i] * y[i + 1] ) - ( x[i + 1] * y[i] ); area += ( x[n - 1] * y[0] ) - ( x[0] * y[n - 1] ); area /= 2.0; If the area is a negative number, the polygon or triangle is clockwise, if positive, it is counterclockwise. >From Ronald Golman's Gem (in Graphics Gems II - see section 1 above), "Area of Planar Polygons and Volume of Polyhedra:" The area of a polygon P0, P1, P2, ... Pn, not in the x-y plane, is given by Area(Polygon) = 1/2 * | N . Sigma { Pk x Pk+1 } | where N is the unit vector normal to the plane and P is a polygonal vertex. The . represents the dot product operator and the x represents the cross product operator. Sigma represents the summation operator. | | represents the absolute value operator. Pn+1 is equal to P0. 25) How to join ACM/SIGGRAPH Probably the easiest way to join ACM/SIGGRAPH is to trot over to your local technical library and find a copy of Communications of the ACM. Somewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank. Fill it out and mail it in. ACM membership for students costs $23.00, Voting or Associate Membership $77.00 (yearly) SIGGRAPH student membership costs an additional $16.00, $26.00 for Voting or Associate Members (also yearly). To get TOG (Transactions on Graphics) it's another $26.00 for students and $31.00 for Voting or Associate Members. If you just want to join SIGGRAPH without joining ACM, it'll cost you $59.00 (no student discount). There are surcharges for overseas airmailing of publications. ACM Member services may be contacted via email at acmhelp@acmvm.bitnet. Their phone number is (212) 626-0500. FAX number (212) 944-1318. Snailmail address: ACM PO Box 12114 Church Street Station New York, New York 10257 SIGGRAPH `93 will be held in Anaheim, California, at the Anaheim Convention Center (just up the street from Disneyland) on August 1-6, 1993. 26) Where can I find MRI and CT scan volume data?

Lines: 46 Nntp-Posting-Host: ulkyvx.louisville.edu Organization: University of Louisville >Where did the hacker ethic go? > >We hackers of the 70's and 80' are now comfortably employed >and supporting families. The next generation takes >the radical lead now. Don't look for radicalism among us >old ones; we're gone... Perhaps all of us hackers have become (ICK) PROFESSIONALS? I have noticed my and my associates progression from hackers to computer professionals. It is rather distasteful. It occurs when a series of things happen: 1) one's ego outgrows one's talent/knowledge 2) one's financial situation takes precedence 3) A change in priorities (esp. family) possibly leading to 2) 4) the hacker's attitude makes the shift from "fun" to "work" 5) one's vocation burns away the creativity needed for "the hobby" or the biggest killer (IMO) 6) one's dreams are (sadly) shattered on the hard rocks of society's version of reality. Without the dream the motivation dies, without the motivation the effort seems useless. Another set of problems stems from our children. While most of us remember when there were several completely different computer systems, our children are growing up with just a few choices (MSDOS/Mac/Amiga) and do not enjoy the diversity we did. I remember the great computer fallout of the early eighties vividly as I was forced to stop using skills developed for systems that were now dead. The diversity of systems before then allowed for widely divergent paradigms. That period forced hackers to continually learn new systems in the attempt to keep up. Not to mention that if a program was needed we were forced (in most situations) to write it ourselves as a commercial offering was just not available. Now our children are being taught the "user" mentality. As the number of us "old-timers" dwindle we are not being replaced by the next generation.

Archie servers: archie.au or 139.130.4.6 (Aussie/NZ) archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100 (Finland/Eur.) archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111 (GER.) cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5 (Israel) archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (JAPAN) archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11 (Korea) archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24 (TWN) archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7 (UK/Ireland) archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179 (USA [MD]) archie.unl.edu (password: archie1) (USA [NE]) archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2 (USA [NY]) archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15 (USA [NJ]) archie.nz or 130.195.9.4 (New Zealand) Connect to Archie server with telnet and type "archie" as username. To get help type 'help'. You can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie without the burden of a telnet session. 'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc, vol. 27. To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with subject "help" to "archie" account at any of above sites. (Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000]. Connect to it and specify "archie" as the host name and "archie" as the username.) ========================================================================== 2. Notes ======== (Excerpted from the FAQ article) Please do *not* post or mail messages saying "I can't FTP, could someone mail this to me?" There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message. There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system. You send a message to an automated server saying something like "send comp.sources.unix/fbm", and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail. ========================================================================== 3.

Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes =========================================== Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help. Don't overuse mail servers. There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these mail servers have a command like path a_valid_return_e-mail_address to get a hint for sending back to you stuff. DEC's FTPMAIL ------------- Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field, and having a line containing the word 'help'. You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you must follow in order to get the files you want. Note that the "reply" or "answer" command in your mailer will not work for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL. To send requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply. Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not responsible for fixing ftpmail problems. BITFTP ------ For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC. Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info. +RED +--- + RED - Listserv Redirector is essentially a mail server. + The Server Sites that are available are: + + Location EARN/BITNET Internet + -------------- ---------------- ------------------- + In Turkey: TRICKLE@TREARN TRICKLE@EGE.EDU.TR + In Denmark: TRICKLE@DKTC11 + In Italy: TRICKLE@IMIPOLI + In Belgium: TRICKLE@BANUFS11 TRICKLE@UFSIA.AC.BE + In Austria: TRICKLE@AWIWUW11 + In Germany: TRICKLE@DS0RUS1I TRICKLE@RUSVM1.RUS.UNI-STUTTGART.DE + In Israel: TRICKLE@TAUNIVM TRICKLE@VM.TAU.AC.IL + In Netherlands: TRICKLE@HEARN TRICKLE@HEARN.NIC.SURFNET.NL + In France: TRICKLE@FRMOP11 TRICKLE@FRMOP11.CNUSC.FR + In Colombia: TRICKLE@UNALCOL TRICKLE@UNALCOL.UNAL.EDU.CO + In Taiwan: TRICKLE@TWNMOE10 TRICKLE@TWNMOE10.EDU.TW + + You are urged to use the one that is closer to your location. + Send a message to one of these containing the body + + /HELP + + and you'll get more instructions. Lightwave 3D mail based file-server ----------------------------------- A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access. The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh. The server resides on a BBS called "The Graphics BBS". The BBS is operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1 908/469-0049. It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144 V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps. If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server, please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address: server@bobsbox.rent.com. For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in the body of the message: HELP /DIR And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete directory listing will be sent to you via mail. [ Now it includes the Cyberware head and shouders in TTDDD format! Check it out, only if you can't use FTP! -- nfotis ] INRIA-GRAPHLIB -------------- Pierre Jancene and Sabine Coquillart launched the inria-graphlib mail server a few months ago. echo help | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr will give you a quick summary of what inria-graphlib contains and how to browse among its files. echo send contents | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr will return the extended summary. As an other example : echo send cgrl from Misc | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr will return the Computer Graphics Resource Listing mirrored from comp.graphics.

There are previewers for xview and sunview, also on gondwana. TDDD ---- It's a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF, Rayshade, Imagine or vort objects. Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3): New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley (worley@cup.portal.com) I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes, from semi-trucks to lampposts. These objects are all freely distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them. In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF, Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views in Postscript. P3D --- From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software. The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D without ever looking at the underlying Lisp. The P3D software currently supports nine renderers. They are: Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language, Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan. The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory pub/graphics/programs/p3d.

Yes. Here's what you should do. Keep the vertices in an array, and have the polygons (triangles are okay, but n-sided polygons are slightly more efficient) store the indices into the array of the vertices that comprise them. You set a flag for each vertex when you transform it, so you don't have to transform any vertex more than once; you also do backface elimination before processing the polygon, so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys don't have to be transformed at all. Whenever you transform a vertex, check if it's on the far side of the hither plane; if it is, you can project it right away and store the result. Then do your Z clip; any vertices that get produced will have to have their projection done at that stage. -- Bernie Roehl University of Waterloo Dept of Electrical and Computer Engineering Mail: broehl@sunee.UWaterloo.ca Voice: (519) 885-1211 x 2607 [work]	0

First of all (this is NOT a snide response), if you're confused about this issue, you will stumble over a lot of other things as well. I suggest that the weakness is your reference material. Get "An Introduction to Ray Tracing" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing algorithm. You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam. On to the question. The simple answer is that you just keep adding up all the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity. For example, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up and clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower bound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that's another issue =^). So, you get some illumination equation like this: I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light intensity, as is the light due to transparency. Now, a slightly less hand-waving illumination equation is this: I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the material constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt. So the maximum you can get from transparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a purple-colored glass object. Hopefully this answers your question. I'll forward my "illumination equation sermon" to you also. ______________________________________________________________________________ Steve Hollasch Kubota Pacific Computer, Inc. hollasch@kpc.com Santa Clara, California	0

What's sort of interesting about this whole thread is just how much it has in common with similar threads in groups dealing with other vendor's hardware. I currently deal basically with hardware from 3 vendors - Apple, DEC, and SGI - and thus tend to monitor the groups about those vendor's hardware. Currently, it seems like SGI customers are pissed at SGI about dropping support for the Personal Iris, DEC customers are pissed at DEC for dropping MIPS support in favor of the new Alpha boxes, and Apple customers seem to get pissed every time a new Mac is introduced that's faster and cheaper than the one they just bought. When I used to be a Sun customer years ago, I remember people being pissed at Sun for leaving their 386 and 680x0 customers out in the cold when Sparc came along. What's really interesting is that from what I can tell, the MIS folks in the basement with their ES/9000 don't seem to be pissed at IBM. Why? I have no idea. Either IBM really does take care of their customers better, or they just have their customers brainwashed better than the smaller vendors do. -- Roy Smith <roy@nyu.edu> Hippocrates Project, Department of Microbiology, Coles 202 NYU School of Medicine, 550 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016 "This never happened to Bart Simpson."	0

The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and LightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional photo-realistic images for a variety of purposes. -- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? -- This mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images available to them. The list is for those who own the Toaster and LightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the package. We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as a group. -- WHAT ARE THE RULES? -- Since LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster software, I'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation of the Toaster. However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving specifically around the 3D software, related tools and products. You do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list! -- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? -- To become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail message to the address: lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com In the body of the message enter: subscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain Or just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list. At this point in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated script based system in place soon. There shouldn't be too much of a delay in joining. Expect a "welcome" message within 5 days after you send your request. Then, expect the mail to start flowing in! -- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? -- Contributing to the list is simple. Just mail your articles to the following address: lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com Your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all others joined to the list. Your articles will also be sent to you so you know that your article has made it to the list. However, those addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back to you. So, if you post an article and another members address is no longer valid, your original article will be returned to you. This doesn't mean it hasn't been posted to the list. In fact, just the opposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it couldn't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad address. NOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon. -- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? -- Simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address you used to sign up: lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com In the body of the message enter: unsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain I will remove your name from the list of members. PLEASE, if you join the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be able to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the list! If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send a request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend forwarding of the articles to you. -- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? -- I am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the originating site (bobsbox). However, I can not continue to do this due to lack of disk space. What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a compendium of articles sent to the list. They can compress and store them in archives on their system. They can then periodically post an index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that relates. If there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI hard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin> I have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the list can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past articles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to the LightWave3D mailing list. For information on this service, please send a mail message to: fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com The first command to the server must be "HELP" or "USER name <passwd>". Use HELP to request a current copy of the helpfile. Use USER name [passwd] to connect to the service. Use ? to get a short listing of all available commands. -- NOW WHAT DO I DO? -- Well, sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information. If you have something to offer, please feel free to contribute that information to the list. Every little bit helps. Questions are welcomed! It makes some of us feel important when we can answer them. <grin> If you have any questions or comments regarding the list, please contact me at the address: lightwave-admin@bobsbox.rent.com Cheers, Bob Lindabury	0

The exhibition presents the untold story of the Vatican Library as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of Rome as a political and scholarly superpower during the Renaissance. The exhibit will be on display in the Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress from January 8, 1993 through April 30, 1993. The online exhibit will be available by anonymous FTP indefinitely. The exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections: The Vatican Library, Archaeology, Humanism, Mathematics, Music, Medicine & Biology, Nature Described, A Wider World I: How the Orient Came to Rome, and A Wider World II: How Rome Went to China. Each section consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit directory and contains the exhibit text for that section and separate JPEG image files for each object. This online exhibit includes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit, but also the alternate objects (brought from Rome to be used if there were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items omitted later in the planning process. This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissance scholars in particular, but also to art historians, historians of science or medicine, early music scholars, students of the humanist movement, students of printing and the printed word, theologians, scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies, and to librarians and information professionals. Please get the README file for details on what files this exhibit contains. If you have questions about how to use FTP, speak to your local computer support person.

Keywords: SLIP, PHONE, CSLIPPER, WinQVT/net I have been posting monthly "how-to-setup a SLIP client on a PC" posts for a few months. Lots of work, and imminent graduation have come in the way of posting one of these for March or earlier this month -- for which I apologize. This file includes information on writing a script for University of Minnesota PHONE, and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with PHONE. For additions, modifications and corrections, I can be reached at <ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu> Best wishes, Ashok -- begin SLIP.TXT -- Based on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows, here are my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment. I thank the Trumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Configuring your Modem: a) Turn off DTR (AT&D0&W) I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use to dial my SLIP server (QMODEM) drops DTR when I exit the program and therefore hangs up the line. If you use a program like Kermit or Conex to establish the SLIP connection, then this need not be done. These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit. NOTE: If you use Univ. of Minn. PHONE to dial and establish a SLIP connection, you do not need to turn off DTR. b) Dial and establish the SLIP connection first. This can be done automatically if you use a program like PHONE (from the University of Minnesota) which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the SLIP packet driver. The PHONE scripting language is simple and phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with other SLIP server. In addition, while the only packet driver that PHONE works with is UMSLIP (currently), it is easy to write a batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers. There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and batch file examples. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Configuring the SLIP drivers: There are five SLIP packet drivers commonly available CSLIPPER.EXE Peter Tattam's compressed SLIP driver SLIPPER.EXE Peter Tattam's SLIP driver SLIP8250.COM Crynwr driver (I like Phil Burn's modified driver) ETHERSL.COM Crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over SLIP) UMSLIP.COM Univ. of Minnesota driver (based on SLIP8250) Of these four, I vastly prefer C/SLIPPER.EXE over SLIP8250.COM or ETHERSL.COM for the following reasons: a) It is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 UART b) While using EtherSLIP/SLIP8250/UMSLIP, myself and several others have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a long FTP transfer. c) It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation mode d) When used in Ethernet simulation mode C/SLIPPER seem to work with every TCP/IP application that I have tested it with. Instructions for C/SLIPPER.EXE (and you do not use PHONE) a) Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file according to instructions: For instance if you have a v.32bis modem on COM1 slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600 b) If you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Win 3.1 DOS boxes, then use the double-ended packet driver shim WinPKT.COM -- this creates a virtual packet driver at 0x60. DOS applications in native mode, DOS applications in Windows 3.1 DOS boxes and Windows applications can all use this virtual driver at 0x60. winpkt.com 0x60 0x62 c) If you use QVT/Net, load PKTINT.COM next. QVT/net is configured in QVTNET.INI to use the interrupt at 0x60. pktint.com Instructions for SLIP8250.COM: a) Try getting a version 10 SLIP driver. Philip Burns of Northwestern University has a modified SLIP8250.COM driver that is better at hardware handshaking. This driver is distributed along with NuPOP. b) Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection. My modem is a V.32bis modem on COM1, so here is how I would load the driver. slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 SLIP 0x03f8 57600 c) As discussed above if you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Windows 3.x DOS boxes, you probably want to use WINPKT.COM winpkt.com 0x60 0x62 d) If you use WinQVT/net, load PKTINT.COM pktint.com Instructions for ETHERSL.COM: If you choose to use ETHERSL.COM instead of SLIP8250.COM, the instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference. You will have to DELETE the line "device=*vcd" from the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI. This will interfere with running regular Windows Comm applications (such as Crosstalk), and you will get lots of dropped characters etc. in these applications. This is therefore not recommended. ETHERSLIP would be loaded as: ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Configuring Windows 3.1: a) Make the following modifications to the SYSTEM.INI file [386Enh] section. i) List all your COM ports, with their addresses and interrupts. COM1Base=03F8 COM1Irq=4 COM2Base=02F8 COM2Irq=3 COM3Base=03E8 COM3Irq=5 This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel, but double-clicking on the "Ports" icon. ii) Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer COM1Buffer=10000 iii) Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish to use for your modem to ZERO. This is the amount of time that Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to another application. If you use WinQVT/net and then want to switch from one session to another, and this value is at the default value of 2 seconds, you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash. COM1AutoAssign=0 This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel. Double-click on 386 Enhanced, and under "Device Contention", set the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to "Never Warn" ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Additional notes: ---------------------------------------------------------------------- What to do if you are assigned a different IP address for each SLIP session? I am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each user a permanent IP address, so I do not have worry about editing QVTNET.INI each time that I establish a SLIP connection. If you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in, please try to use BOOTP aware software, and let BOOTP do the configuration for you. However, QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARP will not work over a SLIP connection. To get QVTNet working in a situation such as this, you must do the following: Edit the QVTNET.INI file. Let the [net] section look like this: [net] name= ip= netmask=255.255.255.0 (or whatever is appropriate for you) arptime=20 packet_vector=60 (or whatever is appropriate) Save the changes, and then *write-protect* this file "attrib +r qvtnet.ini" Start your slip connection, and *remember* the name and IP address that you are assigned. Each time you start QVT/net 3.1x, the general configuration dialog box will open. Enter the name and IP address and you were assigned for that session, click on [OK], and you should be up and running. The changes you make will not be saved, as QVTNET.INI is write-protected. A more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP address assignment is provided by Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu) Victor uses the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation. Bootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP, which is then saved to a file called "myip". Another file "noip" is essentially a complete QVTNET.INI file that lacks the IP address. In the final step "myip" and "noip" are copied into a single QVTNET.INI file. An example of Victor's batch file is provided below: ===================================================== slipper com2 pktint.com bootpq -i "ip=\"%%s\"" >> myip bootpq -i "My IP# is: %s" copy /q net + myip + noip e:\com\qvtnet\qvtnet.ini del /q myip @echo off echo . echo Ready to run WinQVTnet ===================================================== For questions and more details about bootpq, please contact Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu) QPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVT/net. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- How do you use PKTMUX over SLIP? PKTMUX will not work over the SLIP8250.COM packet driver, and crashes immediately if used with ETHERSL.COM PKTMUX will work with C/SLIPPER.EXE, when C/SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode. An example of this configuration is shown below: The latest release of PKTMUX is 1.2c; and it is important that you use this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers with applications like Trumpet for Windows (to be released very shortly). [from AUTOEXEC.BAT] lh c/slipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether (packet driver) lh pktmux 5 65 /5 (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers) lh pktdrv 7f 65 (first virtual packet driver used for QVT/net) lh pktint.com (QVT/net pktint.com) pktdrv 63 65 (PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet) Additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within Windows 3.1 DOS boxes. For example, my PIF file to load POPmail is directed to the file "popmail.bat". This is what popmail.bat reads like: pktdrv 60 65 loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60 cd \popmail popmail cd \ pktdrv 60 /u unloads the packet driver at 0x60 exit causes the DOS window to close I have similar batch files that load other DOS TCP/IP applications like PC Gopher. It is my experience that PKTMUX works fine even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOS sessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt. For example within two different DOS boxes -- one for POPmail and the other for Gopher, the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in each instance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- How much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of C/SLIPPER? I have a V.32bis/V.42bis modem in a 386-33 running Windows 3.1 with a reasonably fast video card (ATI Graphics Ultra). Under these conditions, when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded and being used as follows: a) Driver at 0x7f -- QVTNet FTP client session b) Driver at 0x60 in one DOS Window -- CUTCP tn3270 session c) Driver at 0x60 in another DOS Window -- Trumpet for DOS I get FTP transfer rates of 0.8 - 1.0 kb/sec while transferring compressed files. This rate is comparable to that which I get with SLIP8250 loaded as a packet driver, and where a single TCP/IP session is active. If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single session is active, I get transfer rates of 1.3 - 1.4 kb/sec on the same files. While there is about 40% degradation in the performance of SLIPPER, for me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh the performance hit. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- C/SLIPPER and ethernet simulation mode In ethernet simulation mode, C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 works with all the applications that I have tested it with. One or two applications that required ethernet simulation balked at C/SLIPPER 1.2, but even these rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3 When SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with PKTMUX, I get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads "IP:incorrect packet type" or "IP:bad version number". This does not seem to prevent QVTnet from functioning, although I cannot comment on loss of performance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- What can you do if your DOS TCP/IP application does not work with C/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode? In the rare event that you find a package that does not work with C/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author -- Peter Tattam -- PETER@psychnet.psychol.utas.edu.au, and let him know. Chances are that he can fix it. In the meanwhile, you can try the following. I do not know if it is kosher, but it worked when I had problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.2 (C/SLIPPER is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the PKTMUX section) I load ETHERSL.COM at 0x60, run the application and then terminate ETHERSL.COM This also works within Windows 3.1 virtual DOS boxes. However a packet driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS box at a time. So for example, here is my batch file to run Grateful Med (a medical reference retrieval program developed at the National Library of Medicine). ethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600 loads ETHERSLIP cd \gm6 search cd \ termin 0x60 terminates ETHERSLIP exit closes the DOS box and returns me to Windows If you use this method, be cautious about one thing -- don't have any active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time. After closing the ETHERSL window, you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with no problem. BTW, the example above -- Grateful Med, works with no problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PHONE Script Files: The documentation that accompany PHONE, provide good instructions on writing script files to get PHONE to dial SLIP servers other than the University of Minnesota server. For example here is a script that I use to dial a CISCO server at the University that I attend. Background: To start a SLIP connection, I dial our terminal server, and login with a username and password. After doing so, I start a SLIP session with the following command "slip username-slip.dialin.cwru.edu", followed by my password -- again. Here then is the relevant portion of the PHONE.CMD script file - # # CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script by Ashok Aiyar 3/26/93 # Last revised 3/28/93 Procedure Host.CWRU.Login TimeOut 60 'CWRU-TS2 terminal server is not responding' Message "CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script -- Version 1.1" Message 'Waiting for SLIP server to respond' Quiet ON Expect 'Verification' Message 'Request for User Verification Received from CWRU-TS2' Message 'Sending your user name and password' Quiet OFF Expect 'Username:' Send '%u<' Expect 'Password:' Private Send '%p<' Reject 'Access denied' 'Your user name or password was not accepted' TimeOut 30 'SLIP server did not respond to your validation request' Expect 'CWRU-TS2>' Send 'SLIP<' TimeOut 10 'SLIP server did not respond to SLIP command' Expect 'IP hostname or address:' Send '%u-slip.dialin.cwru.edu<' TimeOut 10 'SLIP server did not respond to hostname' Reject 'Bad IP address' 'Incorrect Hostname' Expect 'Password:' Send '%p<' Reject 'Access denied' 'Password not accepted.'

The quick answer -- there is no "clean" way. Below is a batch file hack that I wrote to use PHONE with other packet drivers. In this example, the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER. To use a batch file like this, you must know the parameters with which you plan to use the packet driver -- i.e interrupt vector, baud rate, port address, and IRQ.

Kinsman Precambrian Electronics 29 Falstaff Rd. Rochester, NY 14609 thomask@kodak.com Copyright March 15, 1991 ABSTRACT The format of images created for use by MS Windows 3.0/3.1 applications is documented in the MS Windows Programmer's Reference guide. This guide is intended as a clearify some wording of the specifications, and to put forth a recommendation among the various alternatives. Please send updates/corrections/suggestions and revisions to me. Please thank me for writing this on my own time by keeping my name with the document. Thank you for your respect. This document Copyright, 1991, by Thomas B. Kinsman. If desired, a PostScript version of this document is available. This information is free. You get more than what you pay for. Don't sue me if I'm wrong. OVERVIEW The DIB image file format is intended to be a "Device Independent Bitmap" file format. (What Microsoft means by "Device Independent" is unclear to me.) Four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit pixels. These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM, or Little-Endian) systems. If you are creating them on another architecture you will have to byte- swap all short and long integer values. By convention, DIB images end in the extension ".BMP". This is because March 15, 1991 - 2 - they are a super-set of earlier "bitmap image files". Consequently you will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as "BMP" files. Since DIB images files are a super-set, there are three "flavors" of DIB images: o DOS DIB images. These are the recommended convention, and the form which I will describe how to create. They are intended for applications running under MS Windows /3.0 in a DOS environment. o OS/2 DIB images. My understanding is that these are the flavor of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager. o Old-style Bitmap images. March 15, 1991 - 3 - DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS The DOS DIB images consist of: 1. A "BITMAPFILEHEADER" file header which identifies the file as a DIB file. This header also gives the total size of the image file, and the offset to the image data. 2. A "BITMAPINFOHEADER" image header which specifies the image attributes. 3. An optional palette of colors used by the image. If it exists, this may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries. Each entry is a Windows RGBQUAD structure. 4. The image data itself. The OS/2 DIB images consist of: 1. The same "BITMAPFILEHEADER" file header which identifies the file as a DIB file. This header also gives the total size of the image file, and the offset to the image data. 2. A "BITMAPCOREHEADER" image header which specifies the image attributes. 3. An optional palette of colors used by the image. Again, if this exists it may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries. Each entry is a Windows RGBTRIPLE structure. 4. The image data itself. The Old Style image bitmap consists of: 1. Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a BITMAPCOREHEADER. Which header type is determined by the first long integer (DWORD) value. 2. An optional color palette. This palette may be composed of either Windows RGBQUAD structures (if the header was a BITMAPINFOHEADER) or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures (if the header was a BITMAPCOREHEADER). 3. The image data itself. CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES. Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward steps. The headers need to be created and then written to the file. These header structures are defined in the MS Windows/3.0 "windows.h" include file. Palette information needs to be stored for images that are not 24-bit images. The five general steps are: 1. Filling in the BITMAPFILEHEADER and the BITMAPINFOHEADER structures the basic image information. 2. If the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image, creating the color palette of RGBQUADS. 3. Calculating the total file size and putting this information in March 15, 1991 - 4 - the "bfSize" field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER. 4. Calculating the offset to the image data from the start of the file, and putting this in the "bfOffBits" field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER. 5. Writing to the file the BITMAPFILEHEADER, the BITMAPINFOHEADER, the color palette, and the image data (in that order). The following sections describe structures in terms of MicroSoft C type- defined keywords. The following table describes these keywords for those not familiar with MicroSoft C. _______________________________________ | | | Type-defined keywords in MicroSoft C.| |______________________________________| | typedef | meaning | |_________|____________________________| | BYTE | unsigned character | | WORD | two byte unsigned integer | | DWORD | four byte unsigned integer| |_________|____________________________| March 15, 1991 - 5 - THE BITMAPFILEHEADER This structure is defined in "windows.h" as: typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER { WORD bfType; DWORD bfSize; WORD bfReserved1; WORD bfReserved2; DWORD bfOffBits; } BITMAPFILEHEADER; The "bfType" field is the two ascii characters 'B' and 'M'. This serves to identify the file as a DIB image file. On an intel byte ordered machine (IBM or a compatible), this constant can be formed in C as the quantity ('M' << 8 | 'B') == 0x4d42 on an intel system. The "bfSize" field is the total size of the file. For our purposes this field is equal to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus the number of entries in the color palette times the size of a RGBQUAD, plus the number of bytes of image data. If the image data is being written out in an uncompressed form, this value can be calculated ahead of time. Otherwise, this field needs to be filled in later. Both the "bfReserved1" and the "bfReserved2" fields are always set to zero. The "bfOffBits" field is set to the offset to the start of the image data from the start of the file. For our purposes, this field should be set to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus the number of entries in the color palette times the size of a RGBQUAD. This works out because the image data is written write after the color palette if one exists. March 15, 1991 - 6 - THE BITMAPINFOHEADER This structure is defined in "windows.h" as: typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER{ DWORD biSize; DWORD biWidth; DWORD biHeight; WORD biPlanes; WORD biBitCount; DWORD biCompression; DWORD biSizeImage; DWORD biXPelsPerMeter; DWORD biYPelsPerMeter; DWORD biClrUsed; DWORD biClrImportant; } BITMAPINFOHEADER; The "biSize" field is set to the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure itself. When reading the image file, this value is what is used to determine that the image contains a BITMAPINFOHEADER and not a BITMAPCOREHEADER. The "biWidth" field is the width of the image in image pixels. The "biHeight" field is the height of the image in image lines. The "biPlanes" field should always be set to 1. This data is written out as if there was one color plane. The "biBitCount" field is the bit-depth of the image. This must be either 1, 4, 8, or 24, depending on the bit-depth of the image data. The "biCompression" field tells how the image data is compressed if it is compressed. DIB images support two forms of run-length encoding. However, I have never seen any images which use it, and don't know yet how it works. Set this field to zero (long zero, or 0L), to indicate that the data is not compressed. All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure may be set to zero. A requirement of the interpretting software that it be able to compute these fields as necessary from the previous information. The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be "biClrUsed". For 4-bit and 8-bit images this field indicates that not all of the possible color entries are used and that the image contains "biClrUsed" colors. If you are using only 32 colors with an 8-bit image, then you may only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries. Generally, set this field to zero. March 15, 1991 - 7 - COLOR PALETTES Each entry of a color palette is a RGBQUAD structure. The RGBQUAD structure is defined in the "windows.h" include file as: typedef struct tagRGBQUAD { BYTE rgbBlue; BYTE rgbGreen; BYTE rgbRed; BYTE rgbReserved; } RGBQUAD; The "rgbReserved" field is always zero. For each color used, the amount of Blue, Green, and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is written to the file. A value of zero in the "rgbBlue", "rgbGreen", or "rgbRed" fields indicates that that particular component does not contribute to the color composition. A value of 255 in any of these fields indicates that the component contributes fully to the color composition. IMAGE DATA There are three surprises about the ordering of image data in DIB image file. The creator of this format was determined to be creative, and certainly was. Within the image data, each line written out is padded to the next four byte quantity. So, if you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel wide, you still have to write out four bytes for every image line. The number of bytes per line can be calculated as: bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4; ---or, in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure--- bytes_per_line = (biWidth * biBitCount + 31 ) / 32 * 4; When writing out your image data, you must write it out bottom line first. The bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the first line of image data in the file. For 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is written as you would expect. One bit images are padded eight pixels to a byte. Four bit images are padded two pixels to a byte. Eight bit images are written one pixel per byte. Twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel. However, for 24-bit images the information must be written out in the order blue, green, red. While most image file formats write data out in March 15, 1991 - 8 - an "RGB" ordering, a DIB image file writes the data out in an "BGR" ordering. SUMMARY This should provide enough information to create DIB images from applications such as scanners or for image exporting routines. If you find out any more about DIB images, please pass the information on to me so that I can modify this document accordingly. March 15, 1991 -- Thomas B.

Those >who are familiar with Directory Opus on the Amiga know what I'm >looking for. Well, a few things might help you like the 3.1 File Manager better. 1) To get more than one window simply double click on a drive icon. That it only gives you one window to work with is a fallacy. You can drag files between windows, to any icon on the tree on the left side of the window, and to any drive icon. This beats your "left and right window" as you can have as many open as you wish instead of just two. 2) You can launch any app from within File Manager by double clicking on the executable's icon. 3) You can launch any application and open a document file by double clicking on the document file's icon, provided you have associations set correctly. This is easily done with the menus. The "browse" capability adds a lot of functionality to 3.1. So if you name all your text files with .txt and point all GIF, TIFF, etc. files towards Paintshop or WinGIF, this takes care of your requirement for "text reading and graphics viewing". I know someone who prefers using File Manager as his shell. Setting up all the associations you need is the way to do it. If Directory Opus is half as good as File Manager then it must be pretty good indeed! File Manager just needs you to understand how some things are done. -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Iskandar Taib | The only thing worse than Peach ala Internet: NTAIB@SILVER.UCS.INDIANA.EDU | Frog is Frog ala Peach Bitnet: NTAIB@IUBACS !	1

The WinHelp() function, as I am told by MS, does search your path so relocating MS windows helpfiles won't be a problem as long as you include the path to where you move them to, however, if an application has hardcoded the path into their code so that when WinHelp is invoked it searches the given path (i.e. WinHelp(hwnd, c:\amipro) for example) then WinHelp does not search your path and instead looks only to that directory where you have installed your software. I tested this out on a variety of software packages. I moved all my helpfiles to the drive z:\ and included this in the path statement. Here is the results for different software packages: Norton Desktop Found Helpfiles Windows V3.1 for WorkGroups Found Helpfiles Windows V3.1 Found Helpfiles MS Powerpoint V3.0 Found Helpfiles MS Word Found Helpfiles MS Excel V4.0a Did Not Find Helpfiles (strange) MS Foxpro V2.5 for Windows Found Helpfiles Lotus Amipro V3.0 Did Not Find Helpfiles Procomm Plus for Windows Did Not Find Helpfiles I guess this is better than nothing but it would make sense to be able to specify a global path for helpfiles.

But here's the low-down: WINZIP is a *great* progra, *as long as you only unzip*. It lets you vew files, unzip only selected files, and even puts the files in a /checkout directory, and creates a "checkout" .grp and group if you want to check the program out. It even prompts for deletion of these on exit, if you didn;t like the program. *HOWEVER* (big however over here). I have problems zipping. I don't konw specifics on this, or ammount of consistency, but sometimes when I "zip" a few files, or add a file to a .zip, dos will violate something or other, and I'll be asked (in a kind, micro$oft kind of way) to quit all applications, quit windows, and restart my computer. I don't know (as I said) how consistent this is, as I jdont' zip much (and when I do, now I just go to dos and use it from there, or just use the "run" cmd) but I *do* know it's happened when I added files to an existing .zip file, *and* when I created a new .zip file, using selected files only.

Organization: The Ohio State University Lines: 31 NNTP-Posting-Host: charm.magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu I am working with Visual Basic v2.0 for windows. Specifically, I am working on an application that generates formatted reports. Since, some of these reports can be rather large, my first question is: 1. Is there a way to increase the size of a list box or text box in Visual Basic/windows beyond the 64k limit? As I have not (as yet - being optimistic :-) come across a way to get around the above problem, I am working on the following approach: I am trying to create my own defined template in MS-Word, using the WordBasic Macros so that I can open up Word from Visual Basic(VB) and load this template of mine, which will work in the following way: It will first open MyOwn.INI file (created in VB - at the time when the user selected the kind of report he weanted) and read the section from the .INI file and jump to the appropriate code in template - which will then open and read a file pertaining to the section it read from the .INI file. 1. When using the GetProfileString function in WordBasic, is there a way to specify/change the default .INI file (which is win.ini) to MyOwn.INI file? 2. When using the file Input$ function in WordBasic - is there a way to read more than the 32k at one time? --- Any help will be appreciated. pgupta@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu	1

For instance, the EISA Orchid Pro Designer IIs-E is only about as "fast" as the ISA Diamond SpeedStar Plus, which isn't what I would call "fast." I don't understand why EISA video cards aren't, as a group, on the same level of performance as Local Bus cards, given that EISA video cards have a 32 bit bus to move data around, instead of ISA's 8 bits. Since they are not, why would anyone (me included) pay a higher cost for a EISA video card when its performance is no better than and often worse that a much cheaper ISA video board, such as a Diamond SpeedStar 24X? From PC Magazine's (I think) recent report, I know that ATI makes a pretty fast EISA video card, but it's around $500, which is just about double what my wallet will allow me to spend. And, for $500, I could get a Diamond Viper and still have $100 left over (of course, I'd have to get a Local Bus mother- board too...) Can anyone shed some light on my confusion/frustration? Thanks!

Personally, I'll be blasphemous and say that if Microsoft keeps doing what it does so well, I hope to see much harsher/stricter copyright and patent laws for computer algorithms, concepts, interfaces, and other intellectual properties to protect real innovators. I'd hate to be one who actually does innovate, and then have Microsoft come in like a huge vulture and use their brute mass (development staff, marketing, etc) to get fat off of my innovation. I don't have all that much sympathy for Apple's complaint against Microsoft, since they just took the ideas from Xerox's PA Research Center when the Federal government forced Xerox to disclose their patents over antitrust fears. However, for other companies and individuals who have a great idea, yet get it "borrowed" by larger corporations who can afford to quickly bring it to market, without any licensing from the original innovator, I feel much sympathy.

They told me to look for the files that are stated in the readme file from the win31 subdirectory of the soudblaster directory.

I had gotten an advertisement for it and put it aside with my list of 'I Wants.' After installing the software, it didn't load. No part of the software would load even though the install went seemingly well. I called Deltapoint with the problem and after asking me twenty million different questions about my system.. concluded that I had one of the systems that the software was 'incompatible with'. Of course they're willing to give me my $$$ back.. What a waste of time and energy. The folks on their support line, although nice, are extremely ignorant regarding the workings of Windows 3.1. After my experience with the installation of the SB 16, I learned some of the function of windows dll files. Before sending back Desktop Animator, decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of .dll files I had. I had 2 versions of cpalette.dll one dated 8/92 and > 100K the other dated 1/93 and smaller (the 1/93 smaller version was the one supplied with Desktop Animator). I moved the bigger, older version of cpalette.dll to a directory outside my path. (For some reason, I had the older Cpalette.dll in my Windows directory and the newer cpallette in my windows\system directory.) When I did this, the animator's editor loaded.. and so did 2 other of the applications in the package.. the main application still didn't load. Does anyone have any ideas as to why this would occur or any further suggestions for trouble-shooting? ____ / \__ Darla |\ / @ \ \ \_______| \ .:|> Portal: darla@shell.portal.com \ ##| | \__/ darla@cup.portal.com | ####\__/ \ AOL: kuby2u@aol.com / / ## \| darlaiam@aol.com / /__________\ \ WIX: darla |GENIE: KUBY L_JJ \__JJ	1

I didn't notice it before and I wonder if while installing an application an image of the disk was created, or if Win3.1 automatically created a backup of its files. I couldn't find any documentation on the diskimage utility; having an image of the disk is taking *a lot* of disk space. Does anybody know if this is just something the people who installed Win3.1 did or it is a backup mechanism?

Organization: Motorola (Austin,TX) Lines: 51 NNTP-Posting-Host: ome.sps.mot.com Has anyone observed this? If I copy a large, say 800K+ file (a large PKZIP file for instance) to my floppy drive (3.5") under MS Windows 3.1 via either Program Manager or a DOS Shell, the file copied under the DOS shell has errors whereas the file copied from within Program Manager does not. The corruption is detected by executing "pkunzip -t b:\file.zip" after both copies. The file copied via the DOS shell always shows corruption. Now here's the kicker: I have many windows open while doing this; both DOS and WINDOWs apps. Supposedly all WINDOWs' apps share the same time slice, whereas the DOS apps get their own equal time slice (unless overriden). So, as an example, I have 5 WINDOWs' apps open, 2 multitasking DOS sessions running, and one execution-execlusive DOS shell iconized (inactive). Under this scenario, CPU time is divided into two major slices: one for all the Windows apps and one slice for the running DOS app. When copying under Windows PGM MGR, I'll assume the other Windows and DOS tasks are essentially inactive. Thus PGM MGR gets, say, 80% of the Windows slice and 95% of the execution-background DOS shell's slices. Thus it gets (.8)(.95)^2 = .72 or 72% of the total available CPU time. When copying in a DOS shell, I activate the execute-exclusive mode DOS shell (no other DOS background tasks allowed), full screen, under the Windows task manager. The CPU time available to this shell would be 80% of the Windows slice (assumming inactive Windows applications) and 100% of the DOS slice: (1.0)(.8) = .8 or 80% of the total available CPU time. So why do I get copy errors under DOS if it has the greater amount of CPU time? Is program manager working in a pre-emptive mode during the floppy copy? It must be!

It's got a lot of freaky bugs and *oversights* that are driving me crazy. Tonight it decided that for any graphic it writes out as a TIFF file that's under a certain arbitrary size, it will swap the left and right sides of the picture [!]. Usually it confines itself to not copying things to the clipboard (so I have to save and load pix for editing in paintbrush) or crashing every hour or so. The one nice thing it has, though, is it's "dither" option. You'd think that this would turn colors into dots, which it does if you go from, say, 256 colors to 16 colors. But if you go from 256 or 16 colors to B&W, you can set a threshold level for which colors turn to black and which turn to white. For me, this is useful because I can turn light grays on buttons to white, and the dark grays to black, and thereby preserve the 3d-effect on buttons and other parts of the window. If you understood my description :^) can you tell me if another (less buggy!) program can do this as well?

85	From: glazer@ohstpy.mps.ohio-state.edu Subject: Local Windows .vs. Shared Windows (Discussion) Organization: The Ohio State University, Department of Physics Lines: 110 I would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows from a Novell administrator's point of view. I just got off the phone with MS Access support and was told that they (Microsoft) has decided to implement, as a standard for software support, the LOCAL setup (described below) as the "most advantageous installation". If this is true and Microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation then I will comply but I'd like to hear it from administrators first. The LOCAL Windows Installation: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive (assuming the resources are available). From a network administrator's implementation, he/she would install all windows disks on a network drive using SETUP/A. Then install windows on a per/machine bases by running SETUP off the network to install the complete system on the local drives. In this way, all drivers are available to the SETUP procedure w/o the need to change disks. Advantages: - Reduce Traffic - Running Windows locally reduces network traffic due to the local access of main Windows files. - Network independence - If the network fails (and they all do at one point or another), the local installation would allow users to keep producing and reduce the cost of down-time. - Faster Windows - Theoretically, Windows will run faster from a local hard drive than over a network. This may be a hard point to prove if the network has an optical backbone and/or the network drives are significantly faster access than local ones. - A user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about varying setups (monochrome, color, types of mouse, etc...) since the Windows installation is assigned to the Workstation. Disadvantages: - Cost - Installing Windows locally requires a significant amount of disk space. Workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent. - Administration - Local windows installations are very difficult to administer. New drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available, each of which would have to be individually installed on each workstation. - Security - Users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system files from simple ignorance. This could result in quite a headache for administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations. - Backup - We all know the problems backing up local hard disks. The backup sets (if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly. Backup individually (to floppy) may not happen at all. This may be eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable applications and *not* user data. The SHARED Windows Installation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Windows is fully installed to a network disk via the SETUP/A procedure described above. Users (or administrators) then install a minimal set of files to individual "user" directories. These directories may be on a local hard disk or perhaps a network "home" directory. The bulk of the Windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory (some 400+ files) and are accessed (shared) as-needed by users throughout their Windows session. The user's files consist of a small set of files that the user has updated during his/her Windows session. These include group files, .INI files and other regularly updated files. Advantages: - A single location for all files makes updates to drives easy. As an updated driver becomes available, it only needs to be installed in this single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it. - Assuming that the users' files are maintained in network (home) directories, the administrator can easily edit any .INI file as-needed to correct problems that may arise. This includes WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI. - Backup of all pertinent files is done easily. Even if the users' files are on a local hard disk, the bulk of the Windows system is backed up with all driver updates. Disadvantages: - Network traffic - since all Windows files are being shared in a network directory, traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the speed of Windows. - If the network crashes, all production comes to a stop since Window's is reliant upon the network for its files. Loss of data usually occurs as well since users working in Windows at the time of the crash will usually not be able to save their work. - Although minimal, disk space is still a consideration. If the users' files are maintained on the network, a large number of users can cause a significant utilization of disk space due to their personal Windows files alone. - Users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation hardware are similar. This is due to the Windows installation being tied to a particular username (in the case of Network user files). The Discussion ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I would like to know, from other administrators with a large Windows userbase, how they prefer setting up Windows. Personally, I have setup numerous installations using the SHARED setup. All Windows and application files are on the network with little or no utilization of local hard disks. In fact, I sold a network on the fact that the company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations and thus save that much more money. I would also like to see recommendations for applications. Should apps such as Word and/or Excel be installed locally regardless of how Windows is installed? Again, I keep all files on the network for easy backup and administration but this is "putting all eggs in one basket"; if the network crashes, work comes to a halt. Now I am sure Microsoft (and I know your out there) has their own ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but I hope to hear from people with "actual" working experience with users and network administration.	1

Windows crashed on all of the time (and from what I have read in PC Mag, this is not the exception) . OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or (generally) anything they aren't supposed to have. If windows works for you, then great. Maybe this is why some people don't see why OS/2 is the OS of choice. If windows doesn't crash on you, and you don't mind waiting on each task, and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS, some of the key reasons for using OS/2 are gone.

I am running Win 3.1 with NDW 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a 6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my applications are not giving back system resources when I close them. When I load windows I start with about 83% resources available but many of the application programs I run regularly (WPWIN 5.2, VB 2.0, WINQVT 2.8, Lotus Organizer, etc.) seem to not return all their resources when I exit them. After a day or two of work I often find myself down under 50% of available resources even when I have no applications other than my shell running. I am aware this is a known problem; what I am looking for are some suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it. 1. What software is the culprit? Win 3.1, NDW, my applications? Are some modes of Win 3.1 (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at plugging this leak? 2. Are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak? 3. Do people know of patches or third party software that help with this? Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a great market for a third party memory company like QEMM. 4. If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside? (I was hoping that NDW 2.2 would have plugged this, but it seems no different than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources.) 5. When I am writing VB code are there things I can do to make it less likely my code will eat resources? 6. Any other suggestions that I don't know enough to ask for specifically? Thanks for your help. As this is a common problem and I have seen only a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending me email. danny =========================================================================== daniel david mittleman - danny@arizona.edu - (602) 621-2932	1

121	Organization: University of Illinois at Chicago, academic Computer Center From: Pankaj Saxena <U09416@uicvm.uic.edu> Subject: TCP/IP through Windows 3.1 Lines: 52 I don't know much about computers, so please bear with me. Here's my question: CONTEXT: I use a package called SLIP on my home computer to connect to the university mainframe (an IBM 3090 running VMS/MVS), and log on to my account. When I installed SLIP on my computer, I had to configure it for my modem (14.4 kbs Etronics internal) and had to supply the phone number to dial to reach the mainframe. The way it works now is that I type "telnet uicvm" or "tn3270 uicvm" (either will work) at the DOS prompt. UICVM is the node name of the mainframe. The program then dials the mainframe, establishes a protocol, and gives me the logon screen. "TELNET" and "TN3270" are the names of batch files in my SLIP directory. I have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the session. PROBLEM: I would like to be able to do all this under Windows 3.1 because I hardly ever use DOS directly. SLIP will not run under Windows. I talked to the people at our computer center, and they suggested that I use a packet driver called WINPKT.COM with SLIP. They gave me instructions on how to load it before I start Windows, and how to modify the TCPSTART and TCPSTOP batch files (in the SLIP directory) to ensure that it would work. I did all that and I could run SLIP from Windows, but there were other problems. For one thing, SLIP would not hang up the phone when I exited. I had to run my communi- cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when that didn't work. For another, there were too many errors. It often took me 3-4 tries to connect to the mainframe. Our computer center does not support SLIP under Windows, so I can't keep going back to them with more questions. QUESTION: Is there some other SHAREWARE package that will run under Windows and do what SLIP is supposed to do? I need a package that is not too expensive, which is why I am looking for shareware. I have heard that there are regular commercial packages that do all this, but they cost hundreds of dollars. These are the main requirements: 1. Must be able to run under Windows 3.1 2. Must allow VT100 and IBM TN3270 terminal emulation 3. Must allow ftp file transfers, since that's the only kind the mainframe allows. No Y-modem or Z-modem etc. I believe the ftp transfers are made through a kermit protocol, but I'm hazy about that. A subsidiary feature (that would be nice to have) if it's a true Windows program (rather than a DOS program modified to run under Windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet session and other applications. Any information received is appreciated. Pankaj Saxena u09416@uicvm.uic.edu	1

Nntp-Posting-Host: oyster.vast.unsw.edu.au Organization: University of New South Wales, Kensington, Australia Lines: 236 (I have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over a week. If you do get multiple copies, my apologies.) Here is a challenge to Microsoft or Microsort Supporters to defend the pathetic state of DOS 6 as an upgrade distribution -- it is a long story but would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the potential pitfalls of "upgrading" to DOS 6 that I have been able to notice after only about a week of playing around with it. My envorinment ============== TI TravelMate 4000 WinSX (486SX/25) 4M Ram 120M Disk System BIOS version 1.03 05/21/92 by Texas Instruments CL-GD6420 VGA BIOS v 1.03 a1 by Cirrus Logic & Quadtel Advance Power Manager BATTERY.PRO v b6.00 by Texas Instruments Smart Drive Cache (WIN3.1/DOS6) Parameters: 2048 1024 a- b- Windows Benchmark WinBench(tm) v 3.11 02/11/93 by ZD Labs After "updgrading" to DOS 6, I could not understand why certain things became so slow, especially after I decided to try 'dblspace'. In the process of finding out why, I discovered some interesting things. Disk Performance with Double Space and Smart Drive ================================================== While most things did not appear to slow down most of the time, certain applications appeared to run very much slower. What was interesting is that commands like 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' were running far too slowly to consider them useful by any standards. I suspected Double Space (DS) and decided to measure its impact on my system using WinBench(tm). The Real Disk WINMARK of 20350 for the original system (as shipped from factory with DOS 5 and Windowws 3.1) became 10718 when "upgraded" to DOS 6 with DS. Thus there is an effective performance degradation of more than 50 percent which did not really surprise me because I knew that DS compression must cost something. Specifically, for short sequential reads up to 512 bytes, DS actually *improves* transfer rates by about 10% (because CPU being faster than I/O, more CPU cycles needed for DS is more than compensated by savings in I/O cycles). However, for all other cases, particularly large random writes, the transfers take up to three times as long. While the performance depends on the type of access (i.e random or sequential, small or large transfer units), on the average (based on WinBench's assumptions), the disk slows down to half its speed. The tests alone, done in 'real mode' (see WinBench) and with smartdrv on, do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective statements like 'there is no noticable difference in performance' or even that 'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast CPU and slow disk I/O'. This explained why some applications ran markedly slower, but not why 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' (the latter especially) too so long. Double Space and Windows ======================== DBLSPACE will not run at all from within windows, not even if you wanted to only to get information, not modify anything, or for that matter even check on its usage -- try "fasthelp dblspace" in a dos box within windows and you will see what I mean from the error message you get. How narrow minded can a programer get, I wonder. Yes, this information can be obtained through the mstools.dd add-on to file manager, but this 'mstools' dll does not understand a compressed floppy! (Use the DOS 6 supplement utility to create a compressed floppy if you dont know how to.) DOS 6 Defragmenter is incompatible with TI APM ============================================== Defragmentation seemed to take too much time. Even so, I waited patiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm. This confirmation 'dblspace /def' command for the 120M drive should take no more than 30 seconds (much faster on other defragmenters I have used) but it took 12 minutes. I discovered that if I moved the mouse, defragmentation checking ran faster (the % figure ticked more rapidly). It dawned on me that this had to do with TI's battery saver Advanced Power Management (APM) module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the CPU is idle, and it obviously thought DS defragmentation was an idle process! After disabling the TI's power saver, this operation took only 20 seconds. Microsft programmers think TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD users are idiots ==================================================================== In the readme.txt file, you can find the the following Running Microsoft Backup with TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD computers ---------------------------------------------------------------- To avoid a conflict between the Turbo feature and Microsoft Backup for Windows or MS-DOS, add a /L0 switch to the DEVICE command in your CONFIG.SYS that loads the BATTERY.PRO file. Or, before you run Microsoft Backup, type SETPOWER /L0 at the command prompt. If you checked TI's manual on the /L0 option, you will realise that it means "disable all power saving features of your notebook". Why would anyone want to run a driver disabled! As I have found out, not only does TI's power management interfere with Microsoft Backup as the readme.txt claims, but 'chkdsk' and 'dblspace' (and who knows what else) are crippled by the TI's power saver. It is obvious that there is not such thing as APM specifications. If there indeed is such a thing, then either Microsoft programmers or TI programmers dont know how to read these specifications. You dont have to guess as to who are the idiots. By the way, if you run the advance power management utility, POWER.EXE in DOS6, when you check the status, it says: Power Management Status ----------------------- Setting = ADV: MAX CPU: idle 60% of time. This figure of 60% seems to be the steady state value on my notebook when I am running nothing (windows with only program manager in iconised form). Does that mean that Windows takes up 40% of my CPU all for itself, and that I have at best only 60% left for useful work? Is such an overhead justified (whether or not Windows is an operating system or just another user interface)? (In DOS alone, it reports 99% idle time.) Looks like Windows is a good example of busy waiting type of package that I like my students to study as the classical 'negative' example of our times! Microsoft programmers do not know batch programming =================================================== I like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of addpath statements like this: set PATH=C:\DOS ... set PATH=C:\ETC\BIN;%PATH%;C:\BIN ... set PATH=C:\ETC\WINDOWS;%PATH%;C:\WINDOWS ... set PATH=%PATH%;C:\BCC\BIN ... set PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE% Even though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old one (i.e. c:\dos), DOS 6 installation program modifes each and every path statement, and prepends C:\DOS to its value. As a result, my resultant path has so many DOS's. If the installation program wanted to remove the old DOS path, and add the new DOS path, clearly it has to only scan for the path statement containg the old DOS directory and replace it by the new DOS path. (Even this should only be done if the new DOS is installed in a directory different from the old one being 'upgraded'.) Instead, the Microsoft programmer (if you can call this person one) decided to meddle every path statement I had in the autoexec and prepend DOS to the value. I wonder if Microsoft is so desparate that it would not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process. I started a thread on this when DOS 4 came up, and the Microsoft representative in Singapore called me about this poster. In fact he specifically said his US counterparts saw the poster and relayed the information to him as he did not have access to internet. Now that has not changed one bit. In fact, if you have a PATH statement with %PATH% already in it, is it not obvious that the this statement should not be touched for any reason? As another example of the inability of Microsoft programmers to understand batch programming -- I had the mouse driver invoked as: set MOUSE=C:\ETC\MOUSE set PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE% loadhigh %MOUSE%\MOUSE.COM Guess what MEMMAKER did? It replaced the last statement with LH ... C:\ETC\MOUSE\MOUSE.COM Why is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with LH and its parameters, without touching the rest of the line, I do not understand. DOS 6 Software Quality ====================== DOS 6 is the only operating system I know, in which, under normal usage, you end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the commands that come with it. I am deliberately being cryptic about this: I challenge Microsoft to use all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it. If they dont within a week, I will post how you can create this "ghost" file. Surely if I can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a particular command only twice, I am sure two dozen Microsoft (idiot) programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find it -- that is what I was told how Microsoft "tests the quality" of their products. I think it is funny that Microsoft has found ways to "test quality" when it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested, but can only be built into the product. No wonder they cannot provide any form of guarantees on their products, not even a decent list of bugs that will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond repair! Also, if you run 'dblspace /def' often enough, repeatedly when the disk is fully defragmented, you may get errors, that was created by the defragmenters. I got my IO.SYS file size error and it got truncated when I did the chkdsk. This happend only after five successive defragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and with no new file creation since. Microsft, dont you dare reply to this poster on the network until you admit that your DS has bugs, and are willing to let us know what we should watch out for if we have already used DS.

I'm glad we (MS) are starting to remedy this situation with DOS 6 (and it will get better in future releases). You do need to be aware of some history, however. In the mid-late 80's, MS's point of view was that OS/2 was going to take over the world and DOS would be phased out. As such, resources for DOS (and windows, for that matter) development were mostly redirected to OS/2. The theory was to keep just enough resources on DOS to support people until they started using OS/2, so utilities and such for DOS fell by the wayside. Then Windows 3.0 hit the market, OS/2 flopped (1.x, at least...2.x seems to be doing a little better, but its future is still cloudy), and people either stayed with their DOS (3.x and 4.x) apps or moved to Windows. About that point in time, MS made its decision to drop OS/2 for DOS/Windows in the short term and Windows/NT in the long term. DOS 5, much improved over DOS 3.x and 4.x, was the first result of MS's refocussing on DOS and Windows. Version 6 takes things somewhat further and I suspect future versions will offer even more in terms of "real" OS features (I work on NT and have no real clue about what my coworkers over in DOSland are doing, but I do know that there are a heck of a lot more of them than there were a few years ago). ...Dave Of course these are my opinions.

It has been done, but the other companies don't have the marketing budgets that MS do. 4DOS, for instance, is everything that COMMAND.COM should have been (but never could be under MS). Those who use it usually find it more addictive than crack cocaine. But they have to rely on word of mouth for sales. It seems to have worked pretty good so far, but your corporate weenie manager type usually likes to see a big glossy ad in PC Magazine. That's okay, marketing isn't a fundamental human right, but they've got a product that's superior to the DOS command interpreter in every way. They have a lot more to be proud of than MS does. If MS really gave a damn, they could duplicate it, buy it outright (they've got the money), or even use the old ruse of sending engineers out to help them with compatability issues and absconding with the technology. DOS is a mediocre product at a cheap price backed up by top notch marketing and vendor agreements. The "mediocre" was excusable in the early days when it was someone else's hack, but they've had ten years to play with it. An interesting thought on that: Most MS products that I'm aware of in the last few years allow you to access the names of the designers and programmers through easter egg screens, including Windows, or at least have the names buried in the files. Is there such a thing in DOS 5.0 and 6.0, or are they too ashamed to have their names on it? -- There's at least one fool in every married couple.	1

Just because a fax modem behaves like a printer on a "local" machine, doesn't guarantee functionality when a "local" machine has fax software printing to a "remotely installed" fax card. I tried this with Workgroups and the fax software didn't like it at all. Could have been WinFAX's peculiarisms but I don't think so. A lot of special hardware interaction takes place internally. In my case, a FAX manager program merely "intercepts" the print job and spools it to it's own directory, not print manager's spool directory. To software, it appears the job was "printed". Print Manager plays NO part in the handling of the actual process. Pardon me if I've incorrectly assumed this is what you were up to. A truely network-aware fax-modem will most likely be required, or a lot of weird setup and tinkering. Good luck.	1

Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (at least), but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for bus transactions between the two busses. Most ISA boards require multiple clocks per bus transaction -- typically this is around 3-4. EISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a 1:1 rate, so I would expect performance to be 6x-8x that of an ISA card. So I guess, for me, the question is unanswered still. I would expect him to be able to see a 6x speed difference, and he apparently does not. -- "Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world." -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Fred.McCall@dseg.ti.com - I don't speak for others and they don't speak for me.	1

First a general description of the machine as follows: Motherboard: Utron 33 mhz Opti chipset, 20 meg memory, 256kb cache (soon I hope to drop a DX2 chip into it) Fahrenheit 1280 video (1 meg, 1024x768x256) ProAudio Spectrum 16 sound board primary disk = Connor CP30174 on a caching IDE controller secondary disk = Conner CP30174 as slave on same controller tertiary disk = Fujitsu ??? 650 meg on Superstore ESDI controller planned future disks include SCSI HD and CD ROM on PAS16 SCSI port Tape drive is a Colorado Jumbo 250 on the Floppy controller future tape drive may be a DAT on the SCSI interface. Other hardware includes modem/fax, serial ports, and a teletext board (ugly dos software drives the latter) Applications used include normal windows stuff (excel, word, Quicken and Turbo Pascal/Windows) but the important stuff is my Audio work environment which includes Turtle beach Wave for Windows, MCS Stereo, and other misc stuff for dinking around with audio files. Also I use Stacker on the primary drive, HP Newwave (for my wife's use, and she won't let me get rid of it!), and a product called Infinite Disk from Chili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom used offline files. I plan to upgrade to NT, when it becomes a released product. I was stongly tempted to become a beta user early on, but I don't have time to mess around with the hassles of beta software. I expect to buy it, tear off the shrink wrap, and use it without hassle (I know, unrealistic, but I can hope can't I, after all, I have work to do). The advice I want concerns the state of NT regarding device drivers, and hardware specific stuff in general. How smoothly can I expect the upgrade to go? Can I expect support for all my stuff, or do I still need to scramble around downloading drivers (PAS?, Orchid?, Colorado?) from some bbs, etc. What steps should I take to ensure the installation goes smoothly. Note that I want to nuke dos totally from the system. I'm allergic to command lines! I plan to run a "pure" NT system. Also, will NT communicate with the workgroups lan? What about stacker? I currently have stacker on the first disk drive. Without Stacker, and the Infinite Disk product, I will have great difficulty fitting everything I have on the system (It's cramped now). I realize Stacker will be incompatible with NT, but will there be an NT version? Or will NT support compression a la Dos 6? I know Infinite Disk will be incompatible with NT, but will they offer (or does anybody else) a comparable product for NT and at what cost? (perhaps I need to ask Chili Pepper that question) I can live without ID if I have to, but I'd rather not. Will NT run my DOS apps (the teletext board mainly) without DOS on the system? What do I need to keep around? Any feedback or advice (including "forget NT" with good reasons) is much appreciated. My only significant reason for moving to NT is I need a better multitasking environment than Windows (among other reasons, WAVE locks up the machine for hours and hours doing DSP processing on large audio files), and I want better lan support than I now have (Internet access, etc). Maybe there are better solutions than NT and if so, I would appreciate hearing about them (OS/2? What's it's status these days?) Pls respond by email and if there is interest I'll summarize for the net. Thanks, Nathan Gregory p00211@psilink.com	1

179	From: revpk@cellar.org (Brian 'Rev P-K' Siano) Subject: Novell and Windows 3.1 Organization: The Cellar BBS and public access system Lines: 35 I'm working at a workstation which is usually attached to a Novell network (using shell version 3.22, I think). The workstation, a 386, was set up to run Windows 3.0 with the network about a year ago. Needless to say, I'd like to upgrade it to Windows 3.1, and have it work with the network. Basically, the Windows files'd be on the local hard drive, but several DOS applications, like Word Perfect, will be on the network. I'd mainly want Windows to access the network drives, the network printers, and perhaps handle some network functions as well. If I could multitask the DOS apps whose executables are on the network, that'd be great, but I could live without it. Eventually, I'd like to get a few other 486s in the office working with the network and Windows 3.1 as well. (However, most of the terminals are 286s, which leaves the network pretty much DOS-bound, and I guess that leaves out Windows for Workgroups.) And in the future, maybe there'd be Norton desktop, but that's gettingahead of myself. As you can guess, I've never done anything like this before. I've read through the networks material that came with Windows, but still, I'd like to know if anyone out there has any experience in such an area. Please reply by Email. I don't scan these newsgroups often. Thanks for any replies. Brian "Rev.

If my disk really crashes, I would at least have to > re-install DOS and Windows to get the backup program working. Using the software you're using, I agree with you there. What I did: I installed DOS, Windows and CPBackup (functionally the same as your Norton, for the purposes of this discussion), and used the DOS "backup" command on just that much. To restore, I boot to the "system" diskette, and use DOS "restore" to read in that much, then boot to windows and restore my full backups using CPB (Norton, in your case), overwriting what I've just restored. That allows me to keep this skeletal Windows essentially unchanged, with all my customization on the "real" copy done using the 3rd-party backup utility. > 2) I'm wrong. There is an easy way to make a "mirror" of a hard disk > that can easily restore it's state from scratch. Seems possible, if you can put skeletal versions of DOS and your backup utility on a "system" floppy.

Just go into the Printers section of your Control Panel. Select the printer you want to re-direct to a file, and click on Connect. Then choose :FILE as the port to connect the printer to. When you print from any application to that printer, Windows will prompt you for a file name for the file into which you want to capture the printout. It's pretty easy.

It can handle TIFF, GIF, BMP, PCX, and many other formats, displaying them and converting between them. There is a shareware version of the program; I assume it's available in the Windows areas of the standard anonymous FTP locations (I'd try ftp.cica.indiana.edu). Log in as ftp, use your username as a password, and look for a program called PSP101.exe or something like that.

What version of WinFAX do you have?

You gave the impression that you should not use smartdrive with stacker. You are correct re: caching the compressed drive. However, as I understand it, you can cache the uncompressed drive. Thus if you have compressed your disk C:, you will have a C and probably a D drive under stacker. C being the compressed disk (which is just a large file on D:) and D being the uncompressed disk.

Well, if it is one of those that comes with windows, just highlight the item by clicking once on it, click on 'File' and then on 'Properties'. You should see a box which says 'Change icon'. Click on it. You are going to be presented with some icons (sometimes just one). If you don't like any of those presented, click on the 'browse' box, and look for the file 'moricons.dll' Select it. Browse through the icons presented, and just double click on your desired icon. If you want to replace it with an icon from some other icon manager, say iconPower for instance, open the icon manager at the bottom of your screen, where it will not block the application icon you wish to replace. When you have found your desired icon, click on it once, and while holding the mouse button down, pull this icon over the one you wish to change.

The user dials up a remote system and downloads a batch of mail as "foo.txt ." I've set up an AutoExec macro in Winword to load "foo.txt" OK, but subsequent invocations of the macro will of course pose file name contention problems. What I'd really like to do is to create an AutoExit macro in Winword that would move "foo.txt" to a specified directory, rename it using the current date and time, and delete the original "foo.txt ." In other words, "foo.txt" gets renamed as "5012300", say, on May 1 at 23:00- the user gets a time-indexed backup of his mail files and "foo.txt" is freed up for the next packet of mail, since my AutoExec macro points to it. My main question is this: How may one rename a file from within a WordBasic macro to include a time/date variable in the new filename?

(Note: some of my other non-windows applications do funny things that appear to be related. Several run slow, my .mod player crashes the system etc..) 2) Running Borland C++ 3.0 before running windows (or any of the other programs) COMPLETELY fixes the problem. Windows will run as fast as I've ever seen it run, easily 10 times faster for graphics than when I don't run BC beforehand. 3) I don't have a memory manager installed in config.sys. Installing emm386.exe does not fix the problem- it makes it worse. After emm386 is installed, running BC will not fix the problem anymore. This problem is driving me nuts. If you think you can help, please reply through the mail. Thanks, Evan	1

I have a 386 PC with lots of disk space and memory, a Postscript laser, Win3.1, Finale 2.0.1 and I recently installed ATM 2.0. I've been fiddling around with the Windows setup for some time, and when I needed to do some work with Finale things didn't print properly. It might - and it might not - have anything to do with the installation of ATM from 1.something to 2.0, but I don't have the old ATM lying around anomore. The most annoying problem was that the Petrucci font didn't print, which is a rather important font :-) I managed to get direct printing to work if I included OwnPS=0 in the [Finale] section of WIN.INI, but Compile PostScript Listing still doesn't work; and it's those .EPS files I need. When I look at the .eps files generated the only font which appears there is Courier. I found out that if I manually changed the Courier 24-point to Petrucci 24-point in the .EPS file everything worked ok, but I'd rather avoid that since I have a lot of songs to work with. And yes, in the Special/Font/Font names dialog box all the fonts I need are listed, with the correct mapping between Finale, Screen and Printer fonts. Finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works well (that is, after I included OwnPS=0), and all my other Windows applications print Petrucci and the other fonts well. Has anyone encountered problems like this? What is the current version of Finale from Coda Music Software? I have 2.0.1 Are the people at Coda available on Internet or X.400?

Answer: The EISA bus does move 32 bits rather than ISA's 8/(16?) But it still moves it at about the speed as the ISA bus. I think that's either 8 or 10 mhz. The local bus designs also move 32 bits like the EISA, but they move the data at the cpu speed, up to 40 mhz. So, on a 33mhz cpu, the local bus is moving 32bit data at 33 mhz, and the EISA is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz. So the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than EISA on a 33 mhz cpu. EISA should be about two (maybe 3) times as fast as ISA. > Since they are not, why would anyone (me included) pay a higher > cost for a EISA video card when its performance is no better than > and often worse that a much cheaper ISA video board, such as a > Diamond SpeedStar 24X?

The EISA bus does have more advantages over the ISA bus than just it's width. For example: more/better interrupts and bus mastering. But these other factors do not impact a video card very much.

Many thanks to those who responded to my question. Unfortunately I have had no luck in actually getting such a font, and a lot of people interested in geting one, and so I have decided to create my own truetype font fitting that description. This font is based on that used in the 1904 issue of Dineen's dictionary and is typical of that found in Irish books from the early part of the century. This may take me some time to do (in my limited spare time) but I'll make it available to anyone who is interested, when it is ready. The responses I received are summerised below: Kevin Donnelly (caoimhin@smo.ac.uk) mentioned that Michael Everson (everson@irlearn.ucd.ie) had developed some Clo/ Gaelach fonts for the Macintosh and may be able to advise me. I contacted Michael and he told me that he has three fonts available for the Macintosh, and that he will eventually port them to the PC, but that he will be charging IR 100 (about $160) for each one. pbryant@ukelele.GCR.COM mentioned that he uses two font that have a 'nice Irish/Gaelic look to them'. These are "Durrow" and "American Uncial-Normal". I don't know where you can get these but I don't think that they have the effects I am looking for. Finally, rhiannon@netcom.com (Rhia) mentioned that the "Meath" font included in the Casady & Greene Fluent Laser Fonts 2 package is very much like what I was describing. I faxed Casady & Greene for info but got no reply. So that's it. I'll post these newsgroups when I make my font available. Colum Twomey.	1

Only a sucker believes an MS released survey results about an MS product. Ok--assume that the results of the survey, whatever they are, are 100% honest.

Well, these "statistics" are to shut people up and add some microscopic weight to MS' arguments. As I just said, you have seen what automakers do. Who is going to believe Chrysler if they tell us, "In a 'random' Chrysler-conducted survey..." My theory about certain people is that they are convinced that if a point is maintained long enough, it is true. After all, what is the focus of this company? Information. Money and information. Technology is, for some, an expedient toward these ends. Why did Bill Gates drop out of college? Was it because he couldn't afford it at the time? Was it because (as the WSJ says) he couldn't wait to use what he knew to go out and make money? Bill Gate's answer to this question would be highly interesting. I await it. I can't stomach Bill declaring himself a visionary and using every available opportunity to build up the cult around himself and then having MS sell DOS and Windoze as their main stays. --------------------------------------------- |kenton+@CMU.EDU | OS/2 FIXES BROKEN WINDOWS | ---------------------------------------------	1

First off all are these good results? I don't know what typical values are. What I'm wondering now is the following. My swap file is currently on the IDE. I could move it to the SCSI which is 13% faster, but then I would not be able to use 32-bit access which might actuall make it slower. So on which drive should I put my swap file to get best results? Is there a swap file speed test program out there? Finally, I also ran the above tests with the ASPI2DOS driver loaded and I got no difference whatsoever in performance. Is there any reason at all why I should load this driver? Thanks in advance, I will post a summary if I get enough responses. -Eric	1

I assumed he was referring to OS/2's 32-bit flat model addressing while DOS (and therefore Windows) use 20-bit segmented addressing. As a programmer, I agree that segmentation unnecessarily complicates things. It's annoying, too. But when just a Windows user, I don't think about it much. And, I doubt many other people think about it (or even care) when just writing a document, calcing a spreadsheet, etc...It works and they get their work done. Just a neutral comment: It's funny, I think, how arguments about Windows vs OS/2 sound so very similar to arguments about Atheism vs Christianity or something like that.

I mainly use windows apps, but in standard mode there is no virtual mem..... plus it is slower. I re-loaded windows, it still does the same thing. Should I first delete everything in all windows dir's?

A sample ftp session is given at the end of this file. ********************************************************************** --> Changes in Version 0.9 (update from v0.81 to v0.9) In this version, we have revised COSY_PAK to take advantage of the more robust signal processing functions available in Mathematica v2.1. Since Mathematica 2.1 provides a better and working LaplaceTransform and InverseLaplaceTransform functions than Mathematica v2.0 did, we adopted them. This has made COSY_PAK smaller. Thus Brian Evans' Signal Processing packages that supported the LaplaceTransform and InverseLaplaceTransform functions in the COSY_PAK v0.81 are no longer needed directly by COSY_PAK v0.9. For power users who use Signal Processing we still recommend the use of the very fine Brian Evans package on Signal Processing (available at the anonymous ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu or IP # 130.207.226.24). On the downside, the disadvantage of this update can be that Mathematica 2.1 requires more runtime resources than its previous version. *********************************************************************** --> For Mathematica 2.0 users We have included the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in the directory `For_2.0'. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0 into the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory. ************************************************************************** --> Introduction This is an unsupported release of COSY_PAK - a COntrol SYstems analysis PAcKage for symbolic control systems analysis using Mathematica 2.1. Classical control systems analysis and design methods and some modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package. This package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a NeXT (TM) computer (a UNIX based workstation). They have been used as a supplementary teaching aid along with standard control engineering texts (Ogata [1991], Phillips and Harbor [1991]) for undergraduate courses in `Control Engineering I' taught at the Systems Engineering Department of CWRU. In addition to the NeXT, they have also been tested successfully on Apple Macintosh computers (TM), and, IBM PC's (TM) running MS Windows(TM). We would be very much interested to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on platforms not mentioned above. IBM users however will have to evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics. Once installed (see below for instructions), this collection of Mathematica packages can be loaded by any user. Bundled with the packages are many notebooks ("COSY_Notes") which demonstrate the functionality of these packages. The notebooks follow a plan of many fine, standard, undergraduate Control Engineering text books listed in the references. Examples used in these notebooks have been collected from the various references given at the end of this file. The contents of the notebooks in the "COSY_Notes" directory are given below. ----------- Begin "COSY_Notes" Contents ----------- NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 01_Introduction.ma CHAPTER 1: Introduction to Control Systems Sections: Analyticity Poles and Zeros Signals Forward Laplace Transforms Inverse Laplace Transforms Differential Equation With Zero-Valued Initial Conditions Differential Equation With Initial Conditions ----------- NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 02_Math_Models.ma CHAPTER 2: Mathematical Modeling of Dynamic Systems Sections: ODE to State Space Linearization of a Nonlinear System of Equations State Space to Transfer Function ----------- NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_*_Transient_Response.ma CHAPTER 3: Transient-Response Analysis (Chapter split into three sub notebooks because of file size) NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_1_Transient_Response.ma Sections : Time Response Analysis First order System Second Order System Third Order and Higher Order Systems NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_2_Transient_Response.ma Sections : First Order System (Step Response vs. Time Const) NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_3_Transient_Response.ma Sections : Second Order System (Step Response vs. Damping Ratio) ----------- NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 04_Steady_State_Response.ma CHAPTER 4: Steady-State Response Sections: Routh's Stability Steady-State Error Analysis ----------- NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 05_Root_Locus.ma CHAPTER 5: Root-Locus Analysis ----------- NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 06_Freq_Response.ma CHAPTER 6: Frequency-Response Analysis Sections: Bode Plot Analysis Magnitude vs. Phase Plot (Nichols Plot) Polar Plot Nyquist Plot Combined Example ----------- NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 07_State_Space.ma CHAPTER 7: State Space Methods Sections: Introduction State Transition Matrix Controllability Observability Output Controllability Pole Placement Design Observer Design Time Response Using State Space Methods ----------- End Notebook Contents ----------- --> Compressed Files The files that contain a complete set of the COSY_PAK v0.9 packages and Notebooks for Mathematica are: COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z compressed tar file for Unix systems COSY_PAK_09.sit.hqx compressed sit file for Macintosh systems and encoded by BinHex 4.0 format (requires the shareware Stuffit file v 1.5.1 or higher). COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip zip file for the IBM PC running MS-DOS Once expanded the Mathematica files can also be used on Macintosh / IBM PC / Unix systems also. --> Installation of COSY_PAK o In UNIX Command line type the following command: zcat COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z | tar xvf - o In Macintosh open the .sit.hqx file using the shareware Stuffit v 1.5.1 or higher. o In IBM Command line type the following command: pkunzip -o -d COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip NOTE: This .zip file was zipped by zip utility v2.0. You must use pkunzip version 2.0 or higher to unzip it. IBM PC's may limit the directory name characters to eight. In that event type "pkunzip -o -d COSY_PAK.zip. You can also unzip the COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip file on any Unix machine if you have unzip utility on it. Uncompressing and untarring "COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z" or unzipping "COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip" will create a directory called "COSY_PAK". Once the files are expanded you should see a single directory "COSY_PAK" containing the following three files, four sub-directories and their contents: SUB-DIRECTORIES in "COSY_PAK": COSYPAK - contains control tool box packages MANUAL - COSY_PAK manual in .ps, .rtf, .txt, and .wn formats. COSY_Notes - contains notebooks For_2.0 - contains Laplace transform package from Mathematica 2.1 For Mathematica 2.0 users. FILES in directory "COSYPAK": chap1.m chap2.m chap3.m chap4.m chap5.m chap6.m chap7.m FILES in directory "COSY_Notes": 01_Introduction.ma 02_Math_Model.ma 03_1_Transient_Response.ma 03_2_Transient_Response.ma 03_3_Transient_Response.ma 04_Steady_State_Response.ma 05_Root_Locus.ma 06_Freq_Response.ma 07_State_Space.ma FILES in directory "For_2.0": LaplaceTransform.m DiracDelta.m SUB-DIRECTORIES in "COSY_PAK": Common FILES in directory "Common": Support.m ********************* Important ******************** The notebook example files(.ma files) will be under the "COSY_Notes" directory. To use the notebooks, move the directory `COSYPAK' to a directory that Mathematica can recognize : /LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages on a UNIX machine, MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages on an Apple Macintosh, c:\winmath\packages on an IBM PC. At the beginning of the "Initialization" cell of each notebook in "COSY_Notes" directory, we list the example about how to make Mathematica identify the directory: (* Initialization of Path *) (* Example For a UNIX machine (Default) *) (* $Path=Join[$Path, {"/LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages"}]; *) (* Example For an Apple Macintosh *) (* $Path=Join[$Path, {"MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages"}]; *) (* Example For IBM PC *) (* $Path=Join[$Path, {"c:\winmath\packages"}]; *) Change the pathname according to your machine by removing the Mathematica comment sign `(*' and `)*' before and after `$Path' setting. This command makes Mathematica recognize the directory /LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages on a UNIX machine MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages on a Apple Macintosh c:\winmath\packages on an IBM PC --> Mathematica 2.0 users We include the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in the directory For_2.0. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0 into the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory. --> Getting started After installation, start Mathematica and open the notebooks in the "COSY_Notes" directory. All notebooks load their own packages. Navigate in the notebooks and enjoy. IBM users however will have to evaluate the notebooks to visualize the graphics. *************************************************************** --> USER RESPONSIBILITIES We request you to take a few minutes and fill out the information below and mail it to us by e-mail / FAX / U.S. Mail.

One workstation in a WfW network goes deaf to any form of communication from other workstations until it goes out on the network itself. From then on other workstatons can interact with it until some time later when it goes deaf again. The workstation is set up to share its discs etc. The machine is a 486DX/33, 8MB RAM, with Diamond Stealth video. It behaves this way with a variety of 16 bit network adapters, including a SMC Elite. It also behaves the same way if I use the Windows VGA driver, rather than the Diamond drivers.	1

Reguarding image >quality and resolution - I have not seen much better. Please do not do this! I don't know how the rest of you read news, but here's how I do it: I subscribe to an "outernet" system which allows me to dial up via modem and download e-mail and news articles automatically. When someone posts a huge attached binary file, I have no choice but to receive it along with all the other new articles in the groups I subscribe to. I also pay for the connect time, which is normally not a problem because I have a 14.4K modem and each day's upload/download session takes only 5 minutes or so. Today's session, however, lasted about 25 minutes because of ROMAN.BMP. Consequently, it cost me about $3.00 extra just to receive a file that I didn't want in the first place. If you have cool bitmaps that you want to make available, there are other ways to do it: either upload the file to an ftp site (like ftp.cica.indiana.edu, which has a complete Windows section) and tell people how to get to it, or use one of the newsgroups like alt.binaries.pictures (or something like that), which are file archives rather than discussion groups. Don't use discussion groups like this one to send out attached files, especially when they're 600K in size. Thanks Ed Klein eklein@spiff.win.net	1

Windows NT (tm) is becomming usable. There are a few things to consider before you make the leap though. First (for me at least) is that you cannot get a full-speed DOS box. What I mean is, I cannot (for instance) run Falcon 3.0 or any other resourse intensive program in a DOS box. It absolutley crawls. And my machine is a 486/33 with a 330MB HD and 16MB RAM. If anyone knows how to get a fast DOS box (or full-screen for that matter), please let me know. The second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff. For instance, my PAS-16 has been demoted to running as a Sound Blaster (which is natively supported -- nice), because MediaVision hasn't produced drivers yet. Your disk should be large enough to keep an 80MB DOS partition, and give the rest over to Windows NT (tm). The only thing is, whenever you wanted to run Windows programs, you'd have to reboot and log into Windows NT (tm), instead of just typing WIN. Windows NT (tm) does seem to be much more stable than normal Windows though. It'd be a good choice if you have the resources. You should really have *at LEAST* 8MB RAM though. One last thing, modems work well enough, but I have yet to get my FAX card to work, and I've never heard of anyone else who did either. It's only better than UNIX because it runs killer software out of the box, whereas with UNIX there isn't the same availablity. I guess it comes down to -- Windows NT (tm) is not yet for the faint of heart, it's still a beta. But it's a very GOOD beta. -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott Reimert \ reimert@mamacass.etdesg.trw.com /Standard disclaimer: Redondo Beach, CA \______________________________________/"Blah blah blah ...

I _do_ know that IBM systems, the PS/2 56SLC2, in particular, have absolutely no problem with OS/2--never had a "random" crash while running any of my programs under OS/2. In fact, I don't remember _ever_ crashing. Of course, I really don't run any OS/2 programs, just the same bunch of DOS and Windows stuff that I've always been running. And when I had the 56SLC (this is the 386SLC system) running Dos/Windows, I had only one crash, and it was consistent. FTP had a tendency to crash whenever I would get large files (>1mb) from particularly fast clients (DTR's 150K-200K/sec), I figured out the problem was with smartdrv's write buffering--if I turned off the write buffer, everything would work fine. FTP under OS/2 has never locked, though. I can even format floppies (to use the most often cited example of the superiority of OS/2.) > For instance, I'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed > WP 5.1 (DOS) locks up my system. Yeah, I guess I'm willing to admit that OS/2 is somewhat sensitive to specific hardware. WP51 for DOS works perfectly fine on my SLC2... > Please explain.

Well, I save all my personal files to floppy, and when i did that under Windows, a floppy save of a large file hung up the system. I also found it quite bothersome to have to continually tweak the tasking options on fractint for dos whenever I wanted to do a fractal computation in the background. >> and not being able to address your memory better than DOS, > Not sure what you mean here. The idea is that OS/2's DOS sessions can see more memory than Windows DOS sessions. I let XPL (a shareware calculus program) see around 720KB of free _conventional_ memory, which lets me do bigger symbolic manipulations than is possible under straight DOS (where it would see around 610KB of conventional RAM.). I also found it really handy for my _own_ DOS-based programs, which, without any re-writing, could now handle larger data sets, simulate for more iterations, etc. Of course, the point is now moot, since the OS/2 programs I now write simply _never_ run into memory limitations. I never programmed for Windows, so I don't have much of a comparison here, though....	1

Make sure that all your drivers (HIMEM, EMM386, SMARTDRV) are being executed from the DOS directory. Loss of the cache provided by SMARTDRV could be your problem; if not, I don't know what might cause the startup delay. My testbed for DBLSPACE (which has a *very* minimal amount of data on the disk so that I don't eat up too much time as I install and uninstall DBLSPACE) boots in about 20 seconds from the "Starting MS-DOS" herald to the end of the AUTOEXEC.BAT execution.

I don't remember Windows setup asking me about 386 enhanced mode (whether I wanted it or not). Now I've got a program that I just bought (Aldus Freehand 3.1) that is telling me that I should be running Windows in enhanced mode (looks like I'm running in standard mode). How can switch to enhanced mode without the little icon thingie? Are there some issues involved with VESA LB systems which cause Windows to not want to give you enhanced mode?

In general, it feels *FAST*, although this is the first VLB card that I have tried. Still, the results are impressive. With my 486DX2/66 w/16 MB, running at 1024x768/256, I've had the following WinTach 1.0 results: Card WP CAD Spread Paint Overall ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ATI Graphics Ultra 13.5 14.5 19.1 25.0 18.0 ATI Ultra+ (no aperture) 11.2 13.8 10.7 20.9 14.1 Hercules Graphite VL 16.1 67.8 41.4 52.8 44.5 Unfortunately I don't have the numbers here, but the ATI Ultra Pro VLB had an overall WinTach score of about 26. The Ultra Pro was nearly as fast in text handling, but was blown away in the CAD and Paint tests. As an additional test, we hand-timed a complex CorelDraw! slide resize/- redraw times. There was no swapping, but I'd expect there is a fairly heavy load on the CPU. The Graphite redraw times averaged about 10.2 seconds, with ATI Ultra Pro at 12.0. This jives with Steve Gibson's contention that the ISA Graphite is faster than an ATI UP on his complex Micrografx Draw document. So far, I'm *very* impressed. The drivers look solid, and the card flies. The installation and utilities are different, but comparable to ATI's. And I didn't have to wait for Build 59 for some reliability... With Hercules' software developer special, you can get an evaluation copy of the card for just $225 (or $200 for the ISA version).

Windows > crashed on >all of the time (and from what I have read in PC Mag, this is not > the exception) I'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare. Windows _itself_ almost never crashes, but it can be crashed by an errant application (My personal favorite? Any one of the Corel 3.0 programs). On the other hand, I have had OS/2 crash randomly a number of times, mostly just running it's own applications. For instance. Today I discovered a new one. While I was downloading with Procomm Plus For Windows (running seamless with the standard VGA drivers on a run-o' da mill VGA card--640x480), I decided that I wanted to edit a copy of a quote that I wanted to add to my .finger. But since I've learned not to really trust seamless, I fired up a full screen WinOS/23.1 session. Whoops, the download finished while WinOS/2 was loading. It had _just_ gotten the pointer up, so I hit alt-escape to get back t the desktop (I have a lot of fonts, so loading takes a good long while). Blam. Screen trashed, Procomm hangs up. Hm. Well, I can sorta see the mouse, so I clicked on the minimized WINOS/2 session and got back my fullscreen Windows session (but the color were off--red and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys). So I closed this, and got back to the desktop (now fully restored). PP+ was still sitting, window open, but it was no longer "connected" to the com port--so I exited it (the normal way-- it told me I was still online and it would hang up, though it was _already_ hung up). Hm. Well, load anothe--no, bad idea. Shutdown and reboot. Ok, refresh first.. Now, shutdown. Yes, everything is closed... Hm. Nothing seems to be happening. Let's see.. Ah, the windows list still comes up. OK, let's try shutdown again. No go. Huh. Alright, wait 60 seconds to see if it's just running slow. Hmm. Still seems to be running OS/2. Try shutdown again. Nothing. Oh well. Reboot. Enjoy the checkdisk time. In this case, a part of the OS crashed not only itself, but OS/2 entirely (which isn't even smart enough to tell when it;s been compromised, I guess). In everyday (specifically _today_) use. > OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or >(generally) anything they aren't supposed to have. That's the idea, anyway. In truth, when a program crashes on OS/2, it will bring the system down with it. The programs that would just GPF under Windows do the same under OS/2, but programs that are fine under DOS and Windows bring OS/2 screaming to a halt, task protection or no. For instance, I'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed WP 5.1 (DOS) locks up my system. It works fine under DOS or even in a dos box under Windows 3.1. (Admittedly, it doesn't crash if I run WP51 full screen, but the first time this bug big me, it bit hard). > If windows works for you, >then great. Maybe this is why some people don't see why OS/2 is the OS of >choice. If windows doesn't crash on you, and you don't mind waiting on each >task, Please explain. The only time I wait on anything under Windows is when I'm copying or formatting a floppy, or when printing (and even then, not long--I get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the printman per minute, and can _still_ go do things--slowly--while it's doing this--I've downloaded with PP+ @9600 while printing). > and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS, Not sure what you mean here. OS/2 sees 16 megs, uses 5 or six of these for it's own use (more if you want to count WinOS/2). Windows sees 16 megs, uses 3 or 4 (more like 5 if you count the disk cache as I am for OS/2) for itself. If memory efficiency were a big issue, PC GEOS would be the current king of the Intel desktop. > some of the >key reasons for using OS/2 are gone. I probably would still use it, but it >would be more of an even fight. On the other hand.. I am finally able to say with some confidence that both OS/2 and Windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to them. For instance, the machine I am sitting at runs both fine, while the machine next to me constantly locks up under Windows. (But ran OS/2 without a hitch once I got it through a 5-crash install). On the whole, I'd say OS/2 is a whole lot more sensitive than Windows, but there are (I suppose) machines that Windows just doesn't like. >Wittism of th week: "I think that it's wrong to believe in an ism, you should > believe in yourself" Ferrish Bueller Wasn't this _Ferris_ Bueller? -- There are stupid laws, and then there are stupider than normal laws.	1

However, I'm a developer at SAS Institute, and one component of the application that I support is the ability to submit a (SAS) batch job from within an interactive SAS session. The user site can enter their site-specific "batch profile" into a dataset within our product, specifying the pathname to the SAS executable, specifying site specific SAS options, etc. At run time certain variables are resolved, and the resolved file is written to an external ascii file. Then I exit to the operating system and run the job asynchronously, returning to the interactive session as soon as the job is submitted. The batch job then runs concurrently with the interactive session. As currently designed, the internal dataset has a record length of 80 characters. But, to run the batch job, the command to reinvoke SAS in batch mode requires more than 80 characters. Up til NT this has not been a problem, since every job control/shell language up til NT (eg. MVS/CMS/VMS/UNIX/OS2) had a way to escape the CR/LF and enter a single command across multiple lines (OS/2 via their REXX language, which is *STANDARD* with OS/2). The gist of all this is, since this application is for end-users, not within my company, I have to try to develop this process using native NT. Since my first posting I've learned that there are several third party companies that provide alternative script languages for Windows/Windows NT. And I'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative script language if they had it, but I can't develop under the assumption that they have anything other than what comes with NT. I saw another post on this list (the subject was something like "Is vi available for Windows?") in which someone said that vi, make, awk, and ***ksh*** was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT. What is that product? Is it a separate product or part of Windows? ksh would do what I need if I could count on it at all NT sites. One last question: I've heard that NT has remote processing capabilities, i.e. I could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run there. If these are native NT commands rather than network specific commands, this would also help me improve this process. If you can comment on these commands, I would appreciate it.

Nobody disputes that OS/2 has more big OS features. The question is Does an individual need the power. The sales of Windows vs OS/2 answer that question. The next question is even if I did want to run OS/2 and I had this big monster machine to run it on, is there a diverse set of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my work. Go to your local computer store to answer this one. I think the comparison you need to be doing is NT vs OS2/2.1. This is where the new battle lines will be drawn. Windows 3.1 has won the single user PC war the next one will be the client server war and the entries are NT, OS2/2.1, UNIX and Netware 4.0. Granted these OS's will be eventually scaled down to be attractive to the single user PC and that will probably be phase II' of the war.

I have three libraries, all on CD, which cost me over two thousand dollars mail order. They are all genuine, high quality EPS vector graphics (NOT just some scans with a silly EPS wrapper!) They are: 1. Totem Graphics color EPS library (about 1400 color EPS images). This costs a thousand bucks mailorder. I rate this clip art as high quality (much better than Dynamic Graphics clip art, SOTMC clip art, etc., in my opinion), but I rate both the 3G library and the C.A.R. library as higher. Totem's art is ALL color -- whereas most of the other's are B&W. It's the best all-color library out there, in my opinion. 2. C.A.R. Graphics library (haven't counted how many images, but you can purchase the library on 48 floppies, to give you an idea of the size). This costs about 4 hundred bucks mailorder. I rate this clip art as very high quality, but it's only B&W. 3. 3G Graphics library (very popular in all the Mac mags). This costs about 4 hundred bucks mailorder. I rate this clip art as very high quality (got some awards in one of the major Mac mags, forgot which). Some of the images are color, but most are B&W. For what it's worth, all three of the CD's are saved in multiple file formats. They are readable on Mac's and PC's. Additionally, Totem's will mount native- NeXT also, although the NeXT could just as easily mount either the Mac or PC filesystems. I've personally tested the CD's on all three machines (I've owned all three machines, although I sold my NeXT a few months ago). Also, in my opinion, the 3G and C.A.R. libraries are the best in the business (and I've seen lots). Also, Totem's is, in my opinion, the best all-color library around, although I like 3G's color art better. I want $850 for everything. Can ship certified check C.O.D., as well as VISA/MC charge. If you pay by VISA/MC, I'll ship pre-paid in the continental U.S. If I ship C.O.D., buyer pays freight and C.O.D. fee. Reason for selling: No longer have DTP business.

At work, I have windows + a postscript printer, but not MS Word. So, I configure my machine at home to use a postscript printer, and use the print to file option, which produces a nice postscript file, which I then bring to work. My question: how do I print this postscript file through the print manager at work? If, for example, I select print from the file manager, it treats the postscript as a text file, and gives me several pages of postscript gibberish. I know that I can open a DOS window and do: copy file.ps com1: which does work, but seems not to multitask very well -- other applications run rather slowly and often pause for 10's of seconds.

I have heard that there were problems > with using it, or at least under older versions of DOS. Please tell! I have been using the JOIN command for many years now, mostly with good success in duplicating unix-style file mounts. You will hear lots of people cursing JOIN because they confuse it with the dos APPEND command (a truely gnarly hack), but don't believe them. You also will hear people saying that Microsoft recommends that you not use JOIN. But, in Microsoft's Windows 4 Workgroups Resource toolkit, the following appears: "JOIN, an MS-DOS utility, works fine with Windows for Workgroups 3.1 if you do not change the state of the joined drives during a Windows for Workgroups 3.1 session. This includes adding or removing joined drives from within Windows for Workgroups. We recommend that you do not use JOIN when running Windows Setup or Windows for Workgroups 3.1." Within this caveat, JOIN appears to be valid under windows. However, I have found a couple of applications that don't deal well with filesystems that have been "mounted" using join. In particular, the worst offender is Word for Windows 2.0x. It gets very confused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive. It wants to create the saved file as ~NNNNN.tmp in the current dir, then delete the old file and rename the ~NNNNN.tmp file to the *.doc file. Unfortunately, WfW usually writes the ~NNNNN.tmp file in some idiotic place other than the current directory (often in the root dir of the joined filesystem, but not always). Then, after deleting the original *.doc file, it can't find the ~NNNNN.tmp file to rename it. Unless you search your disk systems, the document is gone. I have also found subtle problems using the MKS toolkit from a DOS box when JOINed filesystems are present. I used to join c:\temp with a 4meg ramdisk, but MKS sometimes gets confused when doing an "ls" on the c:\temp dir, and misses some files in the temp dir. (This is difficult to reproduce, but it goes away totally when JOIN is not used.) I think this is a Windows problem, rather than MKS's, since it works OK under raw DOS. So, I would suggest that you can use JOIN, but be aware that it may not be as robust you would like. Wouldn't it be real great to "mount" network drives (i.e. Z:) under the main file tree, rather than having all those darned drive letters? Unfortunately, JOIN won't let you do it. There was talk on the net about a simple patch to let JOIN work on network drives, but I don't remember the source. It's too bad the JOIN command is not better implemented, since it would avoid using all those stupid drive letters. I realize that MessDos was meant for casual, even ignorant users, so "mounting" all the drives in one file tree might be confusing. But, it looks like MS is going to carry this over into windows NT (another OS meant for casual, even igorant users -- NOT!). With all it's old family system baggage, maybe MS needs a recovery group so they can get on with life :-(. -- Jerome (Jerry) Schneider Domain: jls@atg.COM Aspen Technology Group UUCP: {uunet}!csn!atglab!jls PO Box 673, Ft.

Organization: NETCOM On-line Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest) Lines: 20 Using a Windows 3.1 printer driver, I would like to "print to a file", with output as a Postscript file. Later, I would like to take this Postscript file to a machine with an attached Hewlett Packard 4M laser printer, and print the document at 600 dots per inch resolution. I would like to use this method to print from WordPerfect For Windows, and from an image processing program that can output images in Postscript. Here's the problem: the Windows Postscript printer driver (pscript.drv) doesn't allow me to specify 600 dpi. In fact, the setup dialog for this driver does have a pull-down menu for "resolution", but the only choice given in the menu is 300! Not a really useful menu. Any ideas?

362	From: kayman@Xenon.Stanford.EDU (Robert Kayman) Subject: SUMMARY: Canon BJ200 vs. HP DeskJet 500 Organization: Computer Science Department, Stanford University. Lines: 401 Hello again, About a week and one-half ago I posted a query looking for people feelings on the inkjet family of printers. Specifically, a comparison between the Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) and the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500. Many people asked me to post the summary/account of all the postings and e-mail I received. Below is my original query and the responses I received. I have not deleted any part of the responses, only the headers and signatures, so you can extract what you find necessary. Some people asked me for an unbiased account; however, the very nature of the question suggests favoritism and biased comments, you must extract the information you believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer. There are a wide range of comments, each has its own value. There was no clear winner, some like the BJ200 (especially its price/performance ratio), others preferred the durability and reliability of the DeskJet (the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid background). Two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention, a new printer to be introduced by Hewlett-Packard later this year (around summertime), and an addition to the Epson product line (their first inkjet). You will find that after the initial purchase, the costs of re-filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same (this largely depends on where you purchase the re-fills or replacements -- so shop around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your printer). No one mentioned approx. how many sheets each ink cartridge will print, but I suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 - 1500 sheets (laser printers will do 4000-5000 sheets per toner cartridge). Well, that's a brief research summary of my personal research. ENJOY! =========================================================================== >Hello fellow 'netters. > >I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I >should purchase, the Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) vs. the HP DeskJet 500.

Just using regular copier paper produced fantastic results just in high quality mode. I compared the output of a Micrografx Designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on my BJ 200 with the same drawing printed on an HP Laserjet IID and I was amazed how well I could read the small print on the BJ 200. Printing speed was several seconds faster on the BJ 200 which is amazing considering that the HP has 2.5M ram installed. I measured the time from when the printer first indicated it was receiving data (as I used print manager in Windows). I showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one immediately for his office, and two other engineers placed their orders too. If you need CDW's phone number, it's 800-598-4239. Delivery to NY was two days. Good luck! Craig Witkowski, CENG51@maccvm.corp.mot.com Motorola Communications & Electronics Inc. Glen Rock, NJ =========================================================================== I own a Deskjet 500. Performance isn't spectacular under Windows using TrueType fonts but neither is the Canon from what I have seen. Quality for the HP is very much dependent on paper quality - on 'standard' photo-copy paper the characters have slightly 'frayed' edges but on better quality 'distinction' type paper things look better. For most applications I find copy paper fine - still better than dot-matrix. Comes with a Windows driver, which seems to by-pass print manager, has a few 'intelli-fonts'which are HP scaleable fonts - probably faster than TrueType but haven't really tried them out. Can get RAM & FONT cartridges but unless the speed of TrueType is a problem I wouldn't bother. The RAM cartridges can't be used as buffer - soft fonts only. For graphics, i.e. BMP images etc the HP can be put into a dither mode via the HP supplied Win driver. There a number of dither options such as 'scatter', 'pattern' etc. The manual gives recommendations depending on the type of image being printed. Text is not so good in this mode. Problem arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text. The range of tones for graphic images isn't brilliant but I think that is more of a limitation with inkjet printers in general. >From what I have seen the Canon is similar in most respects. However, a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from Epson. This printer is faster, cheaper, and capable of producing laser-like quality on normal copier paper. Can't remember the model #, LX - something I think? I purchased my HP days before the Epson was released here :-{. The introductory price on the Epson was the same as the HP here in New Zealand. =========================================================================== About a month ago, I got a Canon BJ200. I absolutely LOVE it. It is incredibly fast, except for printing from PSPICE (I don't know if you ever do stuff with that or not.) Most of the stuff I print is either from Microsoft Word for Windows or just plain text. The only problems I've had are printing headers/footers (the printer freaked out), and printing on cheap paper (lots of streaks). Normal copy paper works great with it, you can only tell it's not laser-printed by holding it, oh, less than twelve inches from your face. (That is, if you're nearsighted, like me! :) ) The printer comes with its own driver for Windows 3.1!! I have no other complaints. The printer also can act just like some EPSON or another for those archaic software packages that haven't written a driver for it yet. The teeny-weeny footprint is a real plus, too--AND, if you purchase it between now and May 31, you get a $50 rebate from Canon!! I bought mine from a store called CompUSA, and the price now is $340. I have a friend who has the HP you are looking at. It also prints very well, and everyone has drivers for it, BUT it is VERY slow! Hope I helped! (360dpi sure looks great!)

I prefer the Deskjet. The printing speed and quality are similar (I tested both with text and graphics before buying the Deskjet for home). The feature that sets the Deskjet apart is the driver support in so many applications. The BJ ends up emulating the Epson LQ or IBM Proprinter to get it to work with many non-windows apps and this will be the case for a long time. The design is superior if you just want to use cut paper, the Deskjet is quieter, AND the ink cartridges are quite a bit cheaper due to the number of Deskjets out there in comparision to the BJs. Just my $0.02 worth.. -- Mike Mattix Agricultural Group of Monsanto P.O. Box 174 Luling, LA 70070 INTERNET Address: dmmatt@bigez.monsanto.com =========================================================================== Yes, there is the landscape mode printing problem, but it does not present a problem in Windows as the Windows printer driver handles the translation. I actually thought of some other points after I posted the note. The Deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately .5inch around the paper the Bubblejet does not. You are right about the graphics resolutions, I tested the printers with the applications I had access to: Wordperfect, Harvard Graphics, WinGIF, Paintshop PRO, and Paintbrush and could not tell a difference. In fact one of the HP Deskjet Windows drivers gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer hence controlling the amount of ink you put down. The Bubblejet did not. I had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no comparision there. Finally, I wanted sheet feeding. In that configuration the Bubblejet cost approximately $100 more than the Deskjet. I went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the Deskjet when I spent my own money. BTW, I am replacing the BJ-300 with a Deskjet 500 at work this month anyway. Regards Mike Mattix Ag Group of Monsanto Luling, LA =========================================================================== I spent some time comparing the two. We ended up getting the Bubblejet BJ-200 versus the HP. Our reasons were: 1) The HP seemed to have worse banding than the Canon 2) 360dpi versus 300 - we felt we could see the difference 3) Price - Canon has a $50 rebate program going on at the moment. The BJ-200 was our choice over the BJ-10ex - we could have 100 pages in the BJ-200 feeder. The BJ-10ex holds only 30 pages, I think. As you can see, up to 100 pages on the BJ-200. We haven't done anything big with the BJ, but its performance seems reasonable under Windows. I know that the Microsoft BBS has a newer windows driver than comes with the printer, but I don't know how it compares (also the driver included with the printer is Canon's whereas I don't know where the Microsoft BBS one comes from - Microsoft?) Hope this helps. -- Thomas V. Frauenhofer, WA2YYW tvf@cci.com, ...!uunet!uupsi!cci632!tvf, tvf@cs.rit.edu Mandlebratwurst: The Meal that Eats Itself! =========================================================================== Altough I'm sometimes also a salesperson (if I'm not suppost to study :-)) I would recommend to buy the BJ200. The printing quality is a bit better, but you you've got much more possiblities. Don't forget the HP engine is at least 2 years on the marked, the Canon engine (witch is also used in other "new" bubblejet printers like e.g. the Epson ones) is quite recently available.. > Now, I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360 > dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs. the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 (300 dpi). > Which is faster?

Which will handle large documents better (75 I've seen during a short demonstration (from someone who tryed to sell me Canon printers) 2 times the same picture, one printed with the BJ200, one with the Canon, the other with the HP, and.. there was a difference in printing- quality,.. The Canon was a bit better.. Greetz, Kris =========================================================================== When we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to inkjet printers. They have near laser quality, speed, and they are quiet. We use both HP Deskjets and the Canon BJ-200s. I prefer the paper handling qualities of the Deskjets but I feel the Canons have superior print quality. The Ideal would be a Canon with a sheet feeder, however I did end up buying a deskjet for home use (got too good a deal). Anyway, we are using Canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well. Out of 15 Deskjets and 4 BJ-200s I have only had one problem with a deskjet and that was taken care of very quickly by HP. -Nate =========================================================================== Whenever I buy anything I look at what the "experts" say, pick out the top few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt. I've been unusually flush lately (no begging letter please) and so I've done this a few times including - about four months ago - with inkjet printers. I can't remember much about the process except that I read about three reviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top. I bought the 500C because of the added dimension of colour (I intend to build a multi- media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner towards that). Although I haven's used the colour thing in earnest yet I tried it out on a couple of Windows bitmaps and I was pleased with the result. I note that even though you can now get the 550C (the one with both colour and mono with no need to change the cartridge), the 500C and 500 are still readily available (at least in the UK). The following are my views/experience: 1. I don't know anything about the Canon except that I came away from reviews (and replies to a posting similar to yours) with the idea that the HP offered the best performance/price ratio. 2. I believe HP are the originals in the field - not always the ideal place to be but the market's still young so one assumes they have the expertise. 3. The 500C is worth the extra. Operation in mono is perfectly acceptable and I get good crisp reproduction of fonts from Windows. 4. I used to work for Monotype when they still manufactured typesetters (before their AMERICAN owners closed them down!) and I can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is pretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor... 5. The HP comes with a reasonable set of drivers. 6. If you buy it invest in the additional RAM pack - it's pretty slow with it, God knows what it's like without! I actually work in Germany and my PC is home in the UK so it's not in daily use. I would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and having a really dumb problem at the start it's easy peasy to operate. Hope this is of use. Regards David =========================================================================== Just bought the BJ-200. I thought the price couldn't be beat ($329, with $50 rebate thru 5/31) and so far it is comparable, even superior, to the DeskJet in print quality. Speed: Per page rate seems to be faster (I don't have figures). I don't print long docs, though. Quality: I think the graphics quality is excellent. Print quality is excellent as well, unless you use small fonts and hold it up close; you can see a lot more "jaggies" than on a LaserJet. The 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the page/print head in place, I would imagine. Large docs: Not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages ... manual says up to 100, though. Haven't tried it. Drivers: No problems under Win3.1 yet. WinWord doesn't want to print the envelopes the same way the Canon does, though. Know nothing of add-on costs. Daniel A. Hartung -- dhartung@chinet.chinet.com -- Ask me about Rotaract =========================================================================== >The deskjet is SLOW. This is in comparison to the other printers I >mentioned. I have no idea how the bubblejet compares. > >The interface between Win3.1 and the printer is just dandy, I've not >had any problems with it. I just bought a BJ-200 printer a couple of days ago. I compared it to the sample print of an HP DeskJet 500 and knew that the HP wasn't for me. The BJ-200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality. I can compare it with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical ( depending on the kind of paper). I don't have problems with the ink not being dry, it seems to dry VERY fast. Probably within a second. Since Canon is giving a $50 rebate until the end of May, it is really a good buy. --- Sean Eckton Computer Support Representative College of Fine Arts and Communications =========================================================================== Wow, it's funny you should ask this. I'm a little behind in news reading so I know this may be late. I just purchased the Canon Bubblejet last night. I was really worried that I wouldn't like it but the print quality, and noise level is fantastic! I printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it printed DAMN near laser quality. You can't tell it's not laser unless you get 2 inches from the page. no problems with drivers. The printer came with the driver diskette which is good because I was beginning to panic when I couldn't findi it under Windows or WordPerfect. It works well under both. I have yet to install Word for Windows so don't know how it works with them. I had a DeskJet 500 at work last year. It was a good printer as well ut I felt it was awfully slow. And much noisier than the BubbleJet. I won't say the BubbleJet is MUCH better, but I really do like it more. Just my $0.02 worth. -=- Brett =========================================================================== -- Sincerely, Robert Kayman ---- kayman@cs.stanford.edu -or- cpa@cs.stanford.edu "In theory, theory and practice are the same.

True, MS products do not boast features that MS invented, but how many products out there by other vendors out there are truely innovative in their continuing development?

But people like me can't afford them. It is true that Apple has lower their pricing on the low end models.. but they are just that...low end. System 7 is a better operating system, but the machines they operate on just are too expensive for my tastes...A UNIX platform is powerful enuf, but tell the common user to set up .Xdefault (i am still confused on what some of them things do) and they either puke or faint. If u think about it, low prices aint innovative if u come down to it. But for the product it offers and on the lower cost (and powerful hardware that it runs on as compare to macs)....MS is kinda innovative..

Those >who are familiar with Directory Opus on the Amiga know what I'm >looking for. I have written the file manager HFM, wich has two windows which compare the files in two directorys to find out wether there are equal or similar files. The 7 most important operations, copy, move, delete, show the file, start a progam, navigate in the directory tree can be invoked by dragging a directory entry with the mouse. This is very convenient, because the selection of the file and the operation to be performed, occur in one move. For bitmap graphic viewing the program vpic can be integrated, for spreadsheat and database files I use the view program from PCTOOLS 7.1. HFM can be configured to use arbitrary viewers to show special data formats. It does also present archives from pkzip etc. as simulated subdirectorys. This filemanager has a somewhat non standart user interface, but it is very convienient to use and is the prefered file manager in several labs in our university. The drawback of this filemanager is, it's still a dos program and the development of a windows version has not yet begun. I use the program package run18.zip, where run tells its windows companion sched.exe which windows program should be started. In this way you can start a windows program from a dosbox. The new version 3.19 (to be released soon) includes a new command for automating this windows program start.

Sci., Urbana, IL Lines: 25 I have been backing up my hard drive ever since I had to re-install everything from scratch after a crash (learned the hard way, didn't I?!). I am using a windows-based backup program (actually Norton), and I began wondering about the logic of this. Sure, if I accidentally delete a file, I can get it from the archive. But what if my disk crashes again? I would not be able to start windows to run the backup program! (Note, by crash, I mean, there was some error message that prevented the machine from booting properly. I think I gave up too early, but I didn't have the time/patience/tools to figure out exactly what the problem was. My hard drive needed cleaning up anyway. Yeah right...) This whole scenario is complicated by the fact that I am using Stacker. So I think there are 2 possibilities: 1) I'm right. If my disk really crashes, I would at least have to re-install DOS and Windows to get the backup program working. 2) I'm wrong. There is an easy way to make a "mirror" of a hard disk that can easily restore it's state from scratch. The polls are open... Tom Ioerger Univeristy of Illinois, CS grad student ioerger@cs.uiuc.edu	1

AT any case, a lot of picture-file viewers that will convert, say, between .gif,etc, to .bmp *will* convert to .rle. I Know for a fact that PaintShop (shareware from cica; /desktop, I think, filename psVVV.zip (I think, where VVV is the ver. number. If that's not true, let me know and I"ll post a corection). This, however, will write your .rle file with a .bmp extension, so you have to rename it. NOW, another thing.... this is from the windows' FAQ: your file has to be less than 64 K ( at least that's what the faq says, but Mine wont work for more than about 30...maybe they mend 32K, I don't know). Your file has to fit VGA size (480 * 860, or whatever standard vga size is.) If you use a non-vga screen (e.g. Cga, ega, svga, there is also a way to do it, but I thing instead of vgalogo.lgo you use another file, such as cgalogo.lgo, egalogo.lgo, or something. I'm not sure about this, as I have a vga, but i'm sure you could find it in the faq (a windows help ver. of which *is* available at cica, but don't konw the filename). ALSO....your .bmp has to be 16 COLOURS Or less. These specs rule out some of the good .bmp's. I found cartoon drawings work quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little memory. Finally, REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR CURRENT WIN.COM before, and put your new win.com in the windows directory. Also, don't start windows from a directory where another win.com is present, as *that* is used instead of the one in the windows dir, and win. won't start. Share this fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie (PF).

(Assuming >a drive which needs formatting) Since there is no BIOS support for ST-506 interface hard disks in an XT, that support must come from a BIOS extension ROM on the (MFM/RLL) hard disk controller. Usually the controller has a ROM-based low level format program (a common jump address is C800:0005 ... you can type G=C800:5 from debug to see) and a small table of drive geometries it "knows" about. Sometimes these are selectable using jumpers on the card, sometimes you can enter them manually in the LLF menu. Failing that, you must use a third-party HD prep program like SpeedStor, Disk Manager, or the like. IDE drives come formatted already, and since the is controller part of the drive mechanism itself, concerns about geometry are irrelevant. Plug it in and go to FDISK. -- Mike Schuster | schuster@panix.com | 70346.1745@CompuServe.COM ------------------- | schuster@shell.portal.com | GEnie: MSCHUSTER	2

I bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from the pc world for a while (I have been running on an xt 5MHz till last january!!). The machine I bought came equipped with a ATI VGA XL 24 graphic card. It gives a very nice picture and the Windows drivers are pretty stable. The only problem is that it is quite slow. I would like to go for a faster card (not in the 400$ range). I saw a lot of comments on many products over the last weeks, but didn't get an overall picture clear enough to make a choice. My question is : Could somebody direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest. I would like to get information about : - the refresh rates the various cards provide; - quality of windows drivers; - standard vga performance (non-Windows stuff). Direct me to a magazine article or something like that (I got winvid.zip info, but it is not enough). If you have an ISA card you are really satisfied with it, let me know. If this information is of any use, here is my system configuration: - Fujikama 486 33MHz ISA system (Contaq motherboard) - monitor DARIUS 14" non-interlaced multisync (up to 1024X768) (can reach 70kHz horizontally) I would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow screen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the EPROM of the graphic card. This is the case with my ATI card and it is very convenient when changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent enough to record settings. Merci a l'avance for any information you would be kind enough to provide me, Guy Lamouche lamouche@ere.umontreal.ca	2

I am interested in using my old power supply (150 W) to power the new hardware, if possible. I have been told by the motherboard vendor that I could probably use the supply if it had twelve wires going to the motherboard. (Apparently some XT vintage supplies had only 11 wires -- the 12th wire is a 5v line used to charge the motherboard battery). My question is has anybody tried bringing an additional wire out of an 11 wire supply OR using an auxiliary power source to charge the motherboard battery? I do not wish to buy an entirely new power supply if I can make use of my existing one with simple hacks. Thank you for any information.

In approximate order of importance they are: 1) The mail/files/news are read/written locally and batched to the network server. (ie. no continuous on-line connection)(NOTE: all users are remote and will use modems over conventional phone lines.) 2) Simple. The users I have for the system have very little computer knowledge have never heard of Unix, and have very little interest in learning. It is essential that the client software is completely pain-free. 3) Cheap. We would prefer not paying high connect fees to an established commercial network, just so we can send large files between members of the group - hence (1). In addition I would like the network server to be something small, simple and inexpensive like a 486.

As far as I know, there is no way to get around the BIOS password except by shorting out the power supply to the CMOS memory, thereby erasing it. This will remove the password, but it will also destroy all the previous BIOS settings, so then you'll have to go and set them all up again. On my 386, there is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of shorting the battery. You just short this jumper briefly, and it interrupts power to the CMOS long enough to erase it. I would imagine there is something like this on your board too. In the future, I would suggest that YOU set the password, and leave it on "Setup" only. That way, no-one else can go and reset it or set it to " Always" unless they know what password you used. They had to do this over here too when they got a bunch of new 386's, for just the same reason. -Dale /~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\ | DALE M.

It makes a horrible whine at times, and I wonder what the vibration is doing to the pins on the cpu etc... -- Rob Scholten scholten@epg.nist.gov End of File, Press RETURN to quit Rob, Don't worry about the whine of the fan it will go away in about 3 weeks of use, mine did... As to the vibration well that something I thought about to as I have a tower case and the mb is mounted vertically. So I mounted the fan on the case so that it just blows air at the CPU and its heatsink instead. Work just like a charm, but the realy biggy to think about is after the whine goes away on the fan. If the fan should stop (burn out) how would you ever know this before the cpu goes up in smoke. Thats what you should be thinking about. I have the parts together but have not had the time to assemble them as yet. But you build a thermistor controlled circuit that will turn on a pesso speaker and a LED when the temp. goes above the normal operating range (96c) or there abouts.

With the directly attached fan units I've seen, it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be a good bit worse than no heat sink at all.

Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive. Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and a standard IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50. I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit). I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU). How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the best system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost? Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost?

This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a 32-bit processor with a 64-bit memory interface, much like Intel Corp.'s Pentium, with the capability of performing as many as three instructions per clock cycle, according to sources familiar with the chip. Motorola is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two configurations, running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50 SPECint89 marks, respectively, sources said. Floating-point performance for the 3.6-volt processors will be even better, as their SPECfp89 performance will be 60 and 80, respectively. The 601, a scaled-down version of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS/6000 workstations, will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chip with protocols to support Motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus built in. The chip, which is being designed initially to support the Micro Channel Architecture, is bus independent, so vendors could develop PowerPC- based systems using a number of different architectures, including ISA, EISA, or Sun Microsystems Inc.'s S-bus design, one source noted. According to sources familiar with the development effort, Motorola has been extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive architecture, despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million transistors using a 0.6-micron technology. Initial chips are expected to be priced from $300 to $400 -- only slightly higher than Intel Corp.'s 486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $100, one source said. ==== END REPOST ====	2

So it would seem that to enhance the design (from 24 to 32-bit EISA DMA) would require an update to the chipset. An update to the chipset may begat an update to the motherboard board design. What I'm saing is: The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this off as a simple fix. In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT along with a possible motherboard layout update. This is not simple. If I were you I would be cautious about this. You might look into the Advanced Integration Research (AIR) VL/EISA motherboard. All slots are EISA/ISA capable. 2 (or 3) of the slots are VL-bus capable. The AIR people confirmed this board supports 'real' 32-bit EISA DMA (I called them). Pentium/P5 (?) capable. Less expensive than equivalent AMI or Micronics VL/EISA board. Look in Computer Shopper (April '93). The ZENON ads show the AIR mother- board. A associate bought the AIR board and is pleased with it.

There are five inputs signals: RD, DSR, DCD, CTS, and RI. There are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software. The IBM BIOS requires asserts DTR and RTS and then waits for both DSR and CTS before sending. When a BIOS recieve call is made, it asserts DTR and waits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an error if DSR never becomes true). It requires CTS to be true for sending AND recieving. Most communications packages bypass this and replace it with their own protocol. The key is that each comm. package could very well have different requirements. My favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end, but also run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end. TD runs through to RD and DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through to SG. I have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it with a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD. The advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS. Gordon Lang	2

I have been using both IDE (or MFM) and SCSI drives for years. I have 2 IDE and 1 SCSI on one system and the other with 2 IDE, 2 SCSI disk, and 1 SCSI CDROM. I currently using ALWAYS IN2000 SCSI card, but I also have a Future Domain, a Western Digital SCSI card, and I work with an ADAPTIC before. As I recall, all these cards can support boot and floppy drive. However, to use with other controller (IDE, MFM...) the boot drive has to be the IDE (or MFM). You CAN NOT boot from the SCSI if you have other controller in the system. If you guys only have 2 drives (1 IDE, 1 SCSI). just set up the IDE in your CMOS setup. Make sure you can boot from it. Then, set up the SCSI controller (IRQ, DMA, etc). Set the SCSI drive to ID 0. Just plug and play for all the cards I seen so far. Only if you have more than 2 drives then you need driver for the third drive and so on. If you have more question, email me, I will try to answer it. Good Luck! William	2

Any opinions expressed are strictly those of the user and not necessarily those of Ericsson. My PC is a 486-33DX (ISA) with AMI BIOS and OPTI chipset. I am thinking of replacing the AMI BIOS chip (dated 6-91) with an up-to-date one (not for any reason, just messing around). My questions are: 1. Do I just take out the old one and plug in a new? 2. Anything else I have to take care of? What precautions should I take? 3. Where can I get the new BIOS chip, CompUSA, mailorder or what? (I live in Orange County California). 4.

I've never taken a real look at the Sportster line (only Couriers), but from what I've gathered, it's basically more of an entry-level modem. probably doesn't meet the same specifications that the Courier does. I'm not sure if the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the (more recent) Courier modems are, so upgrades in the future may be an issue. again, take all of the above with a grain of salt...I've never evaluated the Sportster, so I'm going by bits and pieces that I've heard. if you want a real answer, post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you'll find people who HAVE worked with the Sportster. personally, though, if I were going to look at the Courier modems, I'd buy the Dual Standard...then I'd get both HST and V.32bis. in fact, this is exactly what I did. :-) I'm sitting here looking at my USR DS right now. and now, to correct a few VERY incorrect statements.... folks, if you want to get reliable answers to modem and/or UART questions, post them to comp.dcom.modems. if you post in other groups, you never know what you'll get in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or you may get something like the one below). at least in cdm, if someone posts complete and utter bs, you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (to avoid spreading faulty info). >The Sportster at 14.4 has v.42 error control and v.42 bis data compression. just as it does at lower speeds, too. there is absolutely nothing in either CCITT Recommendation V.42 or V.42bis that says that they can only operate on modems that are running V.32bis. V.42bis, of course, is currently only *STANDARDIZED* for operation on top of V.42 (in its primary mode of operation, LAPM), but that's about as far as that goes. and just in case there's some confusion on this, V.42/V.42bis are also supported by the Courier line (unless you have a really ancient one). >The difference >with the Courier, is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the HST mode. take a second look at the original question: >In a previous article, cs3sd3ae@maccs.mcmaster.ca (Holly KS) says: >>What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ see the V.32bis up there? the question was not about the Courier HST modem, or about the Courier Dual Standard...it was about the Courier V.32bis modem. the modem in question does not support HST, period. it therefore does not support the 16.8 kb HST. also, not all Courier HST / Courier Dual Standard modems support the 16.8 kb version of HST. my Dual Standard only supports HST at 14.4 kb. there are even older models that only run HST at 9.6 kb. >This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of >the same type unit to achieve this speed. HST is USR's proprietary modulation scheme.... but we're not talking about HST, we're talking about V.32bis. V.32bis is most definitely *NOT* a proprietary modulation scheme. >The Sportster will do >asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous. The HST is one way >only. I do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some way..... first off, V.32 and V.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous. this is part of the CCITT Recommendation (i.e., part of the standard). it isn't a feature unique to the Sportster (I just looked at the appropriate chapter in the Courier DS manual). second, HST is not ``one way only.'' more correctly put, it is an asymmetrical modulation scheme, meaning it doesn't work at the same speed in both directions. HST operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction, and has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction. the high-speed channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow. this is fine if you're logged on to say, a BBS, and type one letter and get screens of info back, transfer files (not using bimodem), etc.... there is, of course, a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reverse directions. V.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical, meaning they do transfer the full data rate in both directions at the same time. third, synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with symmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics. >The HST's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available. again, more correctly put, *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeable to whatever ``V.fast'' is called when it's complete. if you have the large footprint Courier modems (like I do), you're S.O.L..... there was an upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety, which could eventually be upgraded to support V.fast, but the cost of the two upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem. later..... --jim -- #include <std_disclaimer.h> 73 DE N5IAL (/4) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ INTERNET: jim@n5ial.mythical.com | j.graham@ieee.org ICBM: 30.23N 86.32W AMATEUR RADIO: n5ial@w4zbb (Ft.

It's still faster than a normal disk read would be. As for the less compression, I've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspace.bin load before anything else. With Stacker, any changes to your config.sys or autoexec.bat meant rebooting twice so it could update those. Personally, I'm waiting for Stacker 4.0 to come out and implement those hooks and stuff. Plus, the DEFRAG that comes with DOS is okay, but I much prefer COMPRESS from PC-TOOLS for sheer bells and whistles. Plus, defrag is sooooo sloooow on a dblspace drive. >But, DOS 6 is quite good; reformat disks? I honestly don't understand WHY >you had to do this. Ditto. koberg	2

While this is true, there are fixes for those who have already bought Diamond cards. In Linux, for example, there are utilities that will put the card in VESA mode before invoking X. Of course, this means no fine tuning of Diamond cards, but at least this will allow those who're stuck with them to use Linux+X.

This is a common misconception, shared my many manufacturers, programmers, and users alike. COM3, for example, is simply the third equipped COMM port, not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8. The BIOS just searches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses. The first equipped port it finds will become COM1, etc. If you're playing by the rules, you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped. The set of "standard" (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the order in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for serial ports. So, what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8. Were this address in the 4th table slot instead, programs which query the BIOS to determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it, as the field in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that there are but 3 COMM ports installed.

OK, here's my results so far.... 1: You have to define the monitor as LCD - it doesn't really support Analogue video input (It works, but isn't very linear...) 2: The incoming sync pulses need inverting. This is best achieved with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter. If you don't know how to do it, don't even contemplate it.. :-) 3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode. OK, having said that, I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC which will act as a universal sync decoder. I want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync pulse edge, and doesn't care about the polarity, outputting the -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires. There are 2 reasons for doing this 1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're in - herc emulation is +,- while MVGA is +,+ for example. 2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes, 3!) monitors sitting on my desk, and I want to get that number down as much as possible. Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA will cut things down to 2. If I forget about Atari colour, I can get down to 1. Ultimately, the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor, but I'm as pressed for cash as anyone else, so it'll have to wait... -- Alan Brown dogbowl@dogbox.acme.gen.nz	2

No. All that I've seen have also an on-board BIOS which enables you to use up to 2 hard drives directly under DOS (2 drives is a DOS limitation and you have the same problem with IDE and all other standards for that matter). Software drivers often allow for better performance, though. You have to use them if you want to use other devices besides hard disks or have more than 2 disks. >Will this also be true of the 32-bit OS's? Obviously these are not able to use the 16-bit real mode BIOSes that are written for DOS, so you need software drivers.

I have had a SCSI and IDE drive working together for some years now. SCSI is supposedly pretty transparent to other types of drives (ESDI,RLL,IDE,etc) - but oftentimes you need to get the correct drivers to get it to work with odd environments. For information purposes, I had: ST-01 Card + ST296N drive and a MAXTOR 212a drive with generic IDE controller running together.

I am enjoying spectacular performance with a Micropolis MC2105 560mb 10ms 3.5" HH 5200 RPM drive. I'll be changing to the BT445 VERY soon, though it is difficult to imagine even higher transfer speeds with the 32bit VESA support. You can call BusLogic and ask 'em about the NT question.

I followed the instructions and set the SB side with DMA 1 and IRQ5 (the default) and then the PAS side with DMA 5 and IRQ 10. My question is how should I configure for MPU-401 compatibility. The manual and installation program recommended IRQ2, but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] to IRQ8-15. So can I still use IRQ2, or should I choose a different one? Right now I have the MPU-401 emulation mode turned off. Actually what is this "cascade to IRQ8-15" business? A related questions (to other GW or VL-bus machine owners) I was told that only DMA 5, 6, 7 are 16 bit DMAs, and 0-4 are 8 bit DMAs. Now what about 32-bit VL-bus mastering DMAs?? Which DMA channel(s) is used by the VL-bus extension to do 32-bit DMA? Yet another question, after installing PAS16, my Links (golf game) will hang the machine when I select SB mode and run, but works with Adlib mode?? Civilization however works fine ( at least so far). Any body knows what I might have done wrong? Thanks (I am obviously a newbie) -- John	2

Here is a rewrite of my Mac & Info sheet SCSI section: SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM. Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM. Normal {asynchronous} SCSI is 5 Mhz; fast {synchronous} SCSI is 10 Mhz. Difference between these modes is mainly in the software drivers. Main problem: there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end. Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. SCSI-1: 8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller. asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave} and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers. 8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}. SCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller. 8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices, which results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1. 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports, electronics, and SCSI software drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}. 32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode, hence term 'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit}. 8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2 that I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software controlers. Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds for SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs. Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT NEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces. Just pop out the SCSI-1 electornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics. Some people consider 16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but 4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1 but is 8-bit SCSI-2. Rule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2. 8-bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI-1 electronics which further reduces its cost compared to 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2.	2

151	From: khoo@husc15.harvard.edu Subject: Upgrading the processor on 386/486 machines Organization: Harvard University Science Center Lines: 43 In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine without spending a lot of money, I looked into replacing the processor on those machines and here are the facts (as I understand them). If you have a PS/2 Model 70 or Model 80, you can replace the i386 chip with either 1) a Cyrix 486DLC chip for $130 which will increase your processing power by about 60% for normal fuctions, and not at all for math functions. This chip will only run at your original clock speed, ie. if you have a 16MHz machine the Cyrix 486DLC will run at 16MHz. note: Windows does not use the math functions, so it is a good upgrade if you are running Windows. Or, 2) you can get a Kingston 486/NOW platform for $450 with a 25MHz i486SX on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100%, if you were running at 25MHz originally. But again it will not increase the speed of your math fuctions. I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even if your original processor runs at a slower speed. There is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX on it. This might speed up your math functions as well, but I am not sure. If you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX or a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it, then you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and replace your chip with it. You should get about 95% better preformance for both normal and math functions. The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip costs $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700. The replacement for the 25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math coprocessor which the 486SX does not have. Note that the speed ratings on the Overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run. If you have a 20MHz 486SX, then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz, ie. 20MHz externally and 40MHz internally. There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is rated at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance. You should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that advertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week. You might want to shop around as prices do vary. If you need a name/phone number for a source for a particular chip, e-mail me, and I will respond with a couple of sources.

The processor when running is too hot to touch so I think this is a (stuff deleted) My 66 DX2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me. I am using the PC Power and Cooling CPU Cooler. This one has precision ball bearings in the motor. It has a pretty substantial heat sink; so if it happened to fail it would still probably dissipate more heat than the bare chip. It attaches with peel off adhesive. This is a full size AT case, so the fan has gravity in its favor. I would be a little nervous about finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let go. All of the CPU fans that I know of are powered from a drive cable. There are other "board" type fans which are ISA boards with a couple of fans mounted on them. They are powered by the slot. I don't know how effective they are; maybe someone else could comment. The cpu is cool enough to touch with the PCP&C unit. PC-Connection at 800-243-8088 has them for 29.95 + 5.00 next day delivery. The Y cord is 7.00 if you don't have a spare lead off the power supply.

My problem is this. My system only had a IDE cable : for one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors : on it, and consequently have to switch cables. The problem is, : the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable : with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card. But : for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug : in the cable to align these. Most IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed circuit board (this is sufficient to determine which side is which). If your IDE drive does not have a label, then you can look for a polarization notch in the receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins). If the receptacle is center polarized, that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide positioned in the center of one side, then you can identify pin 1 as follows: look into the pins with the notch at the top, pin 1 is at the top right. On all drives I have seen this is toward the power connector. As for which pin is pin 1 on the controller, well you can use the same criteria but look hard for the labelling of any pin. Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins 39 & 40 (the oposite end), then you are all set. All you need to do is keep the pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end. You don't even have to look at the cable itself. Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through. Usually the pin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually). But beware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cables with pin 40 being the one marked red. Of course with non-polarized connectors this doesn't matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide which side is pin 1. : Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them. : I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into : the drives. Does it matter which I plug into the "master" drive : and which into the "Slave"? any help appreciated. thanks... It doesn't matter what gets plugged where. But it does matter how the drives are jumpered. There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you should be concerned with on BOTH drives. One jumper will select whether the drive is the slave or the master. If it is the master, then a second jumper selects whether or not a slave is present. You will have to consult the docuementation that came with you drives. If you do not have docuementation, then just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have one. This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like yourself. They will fax you complete info about the jumpers. If you don't have convenient access to a fax machine, then you can usually get voice help. Or post the specific question to this group. (I probably won't be able to help you). Good Luck Gordon Lang	2

You have to shadow the adapter BIOS to get the fast speed.

My friend claims that there will be > little difference > in the temperature of an idle CPU and a CPU running a > computationally > intensive job. From what I've seen in coursework, most CPUs never actually "idle". They will continue to service interrupts, etc., etc. The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matter what it's doing. I suppose depending on the instruction, the CPU may use circuitry which has more transistors than other instructions, but if you consider the additional heat generated by only a handful of additional, tiny resistors and then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU's packaging, the change in temperature to the immediate environment (ie. the surface of the package) will be negligible.

Organization: Netcom - Online Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest) Lines: 64 It seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the Cyrix 386 compatible 486DLC and 486DRU2. My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service: And also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80. The 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX socket (Pin Grid Array, or PGA). The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds. the 25, the 33, and the 40. They do not have a coprocessor on board, but any software query will return coproc as present. I guess they emulate the coproc instructions. Math functions are on the 386DX level without the actual coprocessor. The internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K. Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit rate. My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance boost when it is enabled by software. Overall performance boost from a 386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%. The benchmarks I used were NU SI and QAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones. The performance, with the cache enabled, is about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache, which is around the performance for a 486SX-25. The computer runs noticebly faster, and DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining. The company claims OS/2 compatibility, but I didn't test it. The 486DRU2 is not a chip, as commonly thought. The 486DRU2 is actually a small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX, which contains the logic to manage the clock doubler. This board plugs into the 386DX PGA, and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board. I guess the board doubles the frequency apparent to the CPU, and insert wait states when access to the rest of the system is required. There are no info available from Cyrix there. Anyway, the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16, and 386DX-20 only. Double these clock rates, and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs. If Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50, then they need to put out the 50MHz DLC2 first... I also tested a DLC33 motherboard, along with a Cyrix Coprocessor. With 64K external cache, performance were about 30% faster than the 25, but still significantly (25%?) slower than an actual Intel 486DX. IMHO, the DLC is a great, low price upgrade for people who can't afford, or can't install, a new motherboard. It is definitely worth what I paid for it, but if you need 486DX-33 performance, the DLC33 won't cut it. I'm not sure about the DLC-40, but I think even if it matches the performance, it won't beat it in any significant way. The last time I posted info about the DLC, people sent quite a bit of mail, asking where I got it. So here is where I got mine: Treasure Chest peripherals, they advertise in the Computer Shopper. 1-800-677-9781 The 486DLC-25 kit was $179.00 But.... I liked the chip so much that I found the supplier, and became a dealer. If you are interested in the chip, e-mail me, and I can fax or mail you more info. I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use, So I can;t post anymore info here. However, if there are more questions regarding the 486DLC itself, I'll post what I can. jamesc 909-396-0408 -- ========================================= If someone asks if you are a God, you say...

Please repost this CFV to any newsgroup, listserver or reflector that you think might have a group interested in this subject in order to reach as broad an audience as possible. Every vote counts, so make sure you register yours if you want these groups to be created. Proposed Groups --------------- comp.publish.cdrom.hardware comp.publish.cdrom.software comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia Status ------ Unmoderated. Voting Period ------------- From: The appearance of this posting To: 23:59 EST, 21 May 1993 How To Vote ----------- All votes must be emailed to: manaster@yu1.yu.edu or sent as a reply to the originator of this CFV (manaster@yu1.yu.edu). -To vote, simply copy the example below and delete either the "Yes" or the "No" before each group to register your vote for or against the creation of that group. A line containing "Yes/No" as in the example below, will be considered an abstention with respect to that particular group. Note that each group will have its own separate vote count and that you may split your vote for the groups or abstain as you will.

Ambiguous Votes --------------- Ambiguous votes -- those who do not follow the specified format, or do not make clear the voter's intent, will, where possible, be returned to their senders for clarification. Ambiguous votes which cannot be returned to their senders or for which no clarification is provided will be identified in the final vote tally. Every Vote Counts........Feel free to Flood my mail!!! Rationale --------- The rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or involved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for the discussion relating to their needs. At the moment the main fora for such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither of which have publishing as their focus. Some lists serve the general cdrom community with focuses on library, government and network usage, and until several weeks ago none were devoted to publishing (CDPub has just been setup). In any case a list is not, and ought not, be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups. The reason for the division into three groups is a natural partition of interest between the hardware and software topics, and between the two main focal points of software, i.e. fulltext and multimedia publishing. Topics such as CDROM XA, CDI, CD-R, Photo CD and other related formats would be included as well. Topics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly hardware or software related such as books, copyright issues and other legal matters, packaging, distribution, could be included in the purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software, as would any other nonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom publishing, in any format, and is appropriate to the Internet. The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as index and retrieval software, premastering software, cdrom simulation software, hypertext, sgml, scanning and imaging software, data capture software, data clean up, compression, encryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms. The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that aids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process - audio and video. The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that relates to cdrom publishing, as well as hardware for data capture, such as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware, as well as information that publishers need to know about the hardware that the intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will eventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom. Notes ----- These groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or questions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or questions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like. Requests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general topics should be directed to other fora. Questions about cdroms mounted on LANs should be directed to bit.listserv.cdromlan. Charter ------- Proposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.SOFTWARE The USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.software, will be a newsgroup for discussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them: Index and retrieval software Authoring software Scanning and imaging software OCR and OCR cleanup Hypertext SGML Premastering and Simulation (cdrom) software Copyright and legal issues related to publishing cdroms Other nonhardware topics related to cdrom publishing Proposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.HARDWARE The USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.hardware, will be a newsgroup for discussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them: CD-R equipment Data capture hardware Scanners Video and audio capture hardware Networking hardware Midi hardware Photo CD hardware Publishing systems CDI and DVI hardware Compression and encryption hardware Keyboarding Other hardware publishing topics Proposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.MULTIMEDIA The USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia will be a newsgroup for discussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them: Multimedia authoring software Imaging software Audio and Midi software Color control software Video editing software Audio editing software Multimedia utilities useful for publishers Integration of text, image, audio and video Compression and encryption of multimedia Multimedia copyright and related legal issues Multimedia databases and hypertext Other multimedia publishing topics -- Henry Manaster * EMail: manaster@yu1.yu.edu Brooklyn, NY * Disclaimer: The above is not necessarily MY opinion nor that of anyone else :-) ????!	2

195	From: ken@wybbs.mi.org Subject: *** CONSUMER WARNING *** MidWest Micro (Ohio) Organization: Consultant's Connection Distribution: na Lines: 54 Thinking of buying from MidWest Micro of Ohio? Think *very* carefully. Unless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems, you may want to trade elsewhere. Despite the fact that they answer the phone, "Hi! I'm <whoever> and we're having a GREAT Day!", they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return a modem that didn't work as I expected it to. The details: I ordered one of their house brand "Infotel" 14.4/DF internal FAX modems. In reality, it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over the name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem, I would not have ordered it, had I known this in advance. It arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was preconfigured) as COM4, providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time. For several reasons, I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At the time I installed the modem, nothing was connected to COM2. Although the modem appeared to work, during every connection at 9600 or 14.4, it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After spending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support, they suggested disabling the COM2 port. This appeared to solve the disconnect problem, but was an unacceptable long term solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available, even though they both would not be in use at the same time as the modem. I called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail hell, listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I was then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they didn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line. I called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA number. She promptly switched me to a "Tech Support" rep that implied that it was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA number. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings, a solution I was not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured. Conclusion: I'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system, but it clearly does not work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more than the aggravation or the cost of the modem, I gave it to a local charitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered a Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection. For $30 more, I have a solid external modem built by a company I know will support their users and sold by a company (based on personal experience) will treat me right if there is a problem. I should have known better...	2

I think they are trying to get it out by the end of this month, when it is released though it'll be in limited quantities, I think they have quite a back order right now (the 2 megs version will come out a bit later). Since you have a Viewsonic 17 (I think it has a 78khz horizontal frequency right?), you're gonna love the 2 megs version. It can do 1280x1024x256 at 75Hz, 1152x900x256 at 80Hz, 1024x768x256 at 90Hz(!), 1024x768x65536 at 75Hz. It can also do 640x480x16 mil. and 800x600x16 bit at 90Hz, too bad I don't have such a high bandwidth monitor like yours ;) ;) (most of those modes need a 78khz monitor, otherwise you'll have to use a lower refresh rate) If you want more info. about the coming Graphite VL, you should go to the IBM hardware section on Compuserve (IBMHW), in the video sig.

After leaving F-15 III it would, in vain, try to find a floppy in drive A:. This has been fixed. I don't know what other corrections were made. 2) It comes with an image of the original, in case things don't work. 3) Download glb05.exe. Format a bootable floppy disk, and don't put a config.sys or autoexec.bat. Run the self extracting archive so all the files explode to the disk. Run the file fsh.exe.

Organization: Freshman, Math/Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA Lines: 13 NNTP-Posting-Host: po2.andrew.cmu.edu Just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on. Remember those 21 Mb disks that look and feel like 3.5" floppies? These drives are SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 1.44/21 Mb disks. Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market. Are the prices really that unaffordable compared to CD-ROMs which are currently not rewritable? I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to develop the first MDs for the computer. My question is: why isn't there any substantial interest in developing the flopticals? Just a thought.

It's 1024x768, up to 72hz at that res, and it got a good write-up for image quality in a recent (Feb.?) issue of PC Magazine. As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC in image quality (at least according to the mags -- I can't tell any difference between the two!), but I think NEC is low emissions on only one of the two types. There's VLF (Very Low Frequency) and ELF (I think that's Extremely Low Frequency). The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both. But many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read (I get a bunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which!), which claim "low emissions" but not specifically "MPR-II Compliant" or "MPR-II Certified" only control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other. So, the NEC probably has higher overall image quality (I consis- tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best), but not as low emissions as the Hitachi. I like my image quality, but for all I know you may be more discerning. Good luck! - Mitch v063kcbp@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu (Oh yeah: I got my Hitachi Superscan 15 from Insight for $499.)	2

Then I split the line from the jack in the other room, ran the line into my room into the surge protector and up to my computer. Then I got a regular phone and plugged that into the phone jack in the modem. Now when I try to use the modem, QuickLinkII says "No dialtone". The phone plugged into the back of the computer works fine. I tried unplugging the phone, but still no dice. Is it that the phone line was split too many times? (I don't understand how this could be a problem, since the phone worked fine.) Please note: none of the software or hardware parameters were changed, only the phone line itself. Is my new modem faulty?

Article-I.D.: ncsu.1993Apr22.212557.27590 Organization: NCSU Lines: 10 X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8] I have one of these monitors. It appears to function OK, but is unhookable to anything standard (CGA,EGA,VGA) - it will plug in but gives fuzzy diagonal noise. I also have a graphics board that is apparently a 3270 graphic board (double card with 2 8-bit bus connectors, and a 9-pin female connector with a picture of monitor). I tried plugging these two into a standard AT to no avail. How can one connect these to (the monitor seems to be of relatively high quality, so I'm curious)? Any special drivers and/or setup needed - I can't locate any jumpers on the card.	2

The 8 byte ethernet id is the unique Electronic Serial Number (ESN) assigned to each ethernet board in existence. This is a "physical layer" concept. The IP address is a higher layer protocol. The analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number, while the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or I) physical identification scheme (number). But to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number) it is not supposed to be possible to change the number. Of course the manufacturer can always retro-fit a board, but there could hardly be a reason to ever do that. If your question is actually referring to the IP address, it is most definetly changable. But it is strictly software. Gordon Lang	2

I'm a novice in messing comp. hardware. My original IDE HD is a 42MB Western Digital which came with the system when I bought it. And I just got a 213MB IDE HD Maxtor that I wanted to add as a slave drive. I did change the jumper settings on 213A Maxtor to configure it as slave drv, but I didn't change anything on my 42M Western Dig, since I didn't have any doc. on it. And as I predicted, It just beeped and gave me an error message about HDD controller. So, I had to take my 42M off & install my 213A to be my only HD. any help on this matter would be much appreciated.

These are available from bbs's or mail but the mail version costs a nominal fee. 2. In addition to the master/slave jumper on an IDE drive there is also another jumper to indicate whether a slave is present. Get it right! 3. The cabling is not an issue as long as pin 1 goes to pin 1 goes to pin 1. No twisting or swapping on an IDE cable. Be sure of pin 1 on all three components - do not make assumptions (guesses are ok but assumptions are bad). 4. If the cable and jumpers are correct, and the CMOS setup is correct, then you may have to do an FDISK followed by a high level format. I have NEVER personally found this necesary, but perhaps there is something gone wrong with the data on the disks? Probably not but I understand your predicament - You will probably throw salt over your shoulders, wear funny clothes and do a spooky sounding chant while dancing around the room if someone said it might help.

I've done some ASIC and digital design, but not any CPU design. It would seem to me that on a 486, the FPU is not being used, most of the cache is not being accessed, the off chip buffers/drivers are idle, the multiplier isn't multiplying, the barrel shifters aren't shifting, microcode isn't microcoding, etc. This means transistors aren't switching which means less power dissipated (in CMOS), which means less heat.\ From what I understand, the Pentium shuts down those sections of the CPU which aren't being used in order to cut down on heat/power. -- Dennis Lou || "But Yossarian, what if everyone thought that way?" dlou@ucsd.edu || "Then I'd be crazy to think any other way!"

I've been given an oldish Phillips TeleVideo terminal type thingy, without a keyboard. But no problem so far. When I dismantled it, I discovered that it is really just a standard RGB monitor with built in modem/ROM software etc. Phillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the RGB inputs, so I connected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked - sort of. The problem is that I have no idea where to connect the Sync lines. The display rolls continuously, but does change modes (OK only to CGA - but useful for my laptop). Any of you wonderful people any knowledge of Phillips monitors? I've tried Phillips in the UK and a very helpful guy told me that he has had several enquiries of this sort, but Phillips Computer is now under the auspices of DEC (at least in the UK). DEC said sorry Phillips don't make it any more. What is it anyway? A UK support dealer said "Circuit diagrams? Sync?" So any ideas.

They're very recent, I downloaded them from the Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there, email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well. I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them). I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on Cirrus's part but I don't think so.

Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s, I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets?

I have two SCSI hard drives, each has 512KB of 'cache'. There several reasons for this :- When the drive has read requested data from the disk the SCSI bus may be busy. This data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and the data can be transmitted. When the drive receives data to be written, the data can come down the bus faster than the drive can write it to the disk. It needs to be stored somewhere while the disk is writing it out. In these situations the memory is being used as a buffer NOT a cache!

My >computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone. Simple. First, Andrew is correct, although I can see where there might be some confusion. It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use the same interrupt. They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it is not possible to have both cards active at the same time. Here is an example. For some time, I was short of "free interrupts." I had a tape controller (not a "floppy tape") that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7. (It's an *old* tape drive.) My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where my modem is). I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and the tape simultaneously. When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt handler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port. If the tape drive were to generate an interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape controller. (And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would most likely "hang.") Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it installs an interrupt handler for IRQ3. That handler won't do anything for the serial port. Under DOS, printing is NOT interrupt-driven. Instead, the BIOS polls the status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent. That's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7. Try that on NT and see how far you'll get. :-) -- Kenneth R. Ballou VOICE: (617) 494-0990 Oberon Software, Inc.

Organization: University of Western Ontario, London Nntp-Posting-Host: vega.irus.rri.uwo.ca Lines: 81 Hi: I need some advice (opinions?) regarding which PC would best suit my needs! I want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things: - Editing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 (under dos) - Creating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 (under dos) - Editing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler, running under Windows 3.1 - these images can be large, say 2k x 2k, 24bits/pixel - Using the PC as an Xterminal, running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS, talking to our network of Sparcstation's - this is where a lot of the images/data come from, and is the most demanding of these tasks. I've read, read, read PC magazines, performed benchmarks, read this newsgroup, and decided that a "nice" system (price/performance) would be: 486DX-50 256k cache, ISA, VLB, 16meg ram ATI Graphics Ultra Pro, 2 meg ram, local bus 15" monitor, 1280x1024 NI 3Com Etherlink III 16bit Maxtor 240MB IDE hard drive However, the parts don't fit! Our local retailer apparently put one of these together, only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at 50MHz - surprise surprise. Actually, after reading this group, I'm surprised that they even have a 50MHz local bus running... I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a 486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB, or, a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus the non-local bus version of the ATI card). Which is better, keeping in mind that I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks? Any help would be greatly appreciated! (I need to decide quickly, so any speedy help would be appreciated even more!!) BTW: We have a system now to perform these tasks, it has the following configuration: 486DX-33 64k cache, ISA, 8 meg ram ATI Graphics Ultra+, 2 meg ram 14" monitor, 1024x768 NI SMC Ethercard 8 bit Maxtor 120MB IDE hard drive We're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!! ~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, or been uncovered! There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X! Its sluggish running the local window manager. Also, many functions under PhotoStyler take a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram). There's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive don't leave much room for other apps. Photostyler will page to disk with medium size images. I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates. This machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec on the same network. Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large images). Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming?? Will it make a difference? I'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice (above), for that reason. Also, are there DX2-100's on the horizon? What about DX3-99's? DX3-150's ???!

Ideas and info gladly accepted.) I do not have specific knowledge of Lap-Link or Telix, but my recommendation for ANY package is to follow each one's instructions for making the null- modem cable. The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't really a standard for PC to PC communications. The following is a tutorial I wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems, but you should still check your software! I will eplain a couple of details of RS-232. RS-232 is a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a modem. Actually it can be between any end system and any communications hardware. The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA Communications Equipment (DCE). RS-232 spells out the voltage levels, the connector type, the pinouts, and the signal protocols. The connector is a "DB-25" but IBM has set an alternative "standard" of DB-9. The primary signals are Transmit Data (TD), Recieve Data (RD), and Signal Ground (SG). There are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE. For example, the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate in communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal. DTR is an output on the DTE and an input on the DCE. Similarly, the DCE announces that it is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR) signal. DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE. Ok that's five signals; there are only four more of interest. The Request To Send (RTS) signal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used to ask the DCE permission to send data. If the DCE agrees, it sends an ok via the Clear To Send (CTS) signal. (For completeness, the CTS is an input to the DTE and an output from the DCE). The other two signals (of interest) are Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD). These are both inputs to the DTE and outputs from the DCE. RI is just what you would expect - a signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection to the DCE. This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup. DCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the "connection" has been established i.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE. There - that's it. Oh there are many other RS-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete. I have explained the nine signals that are on a PC. The pinouts are as follows: Name DB-9 DB-25 SG 5 7 TD 3 2 RD 2 3 DTR 4 20 DSR 6 6 DCD 1 8 RTS 7 4 CTS 8 5 RI 9 22 Now to address your problem at hand. When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE to a DTE), there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232 signal definitions don't work out quite right. There is no DCE to assert the CTS, DSR, DCD, or RI. So the common thing to do is to not use these signals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well. If this is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG, and crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other end, etc). The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send data has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready. It would have to just send the data and hope it got through. Therefore a better null modem would include the DTR/DSR pair crossed. A particular point a confusion is in the software area. Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft- ware will use them. If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the serial port, then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to be used. But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge, or Lap- Link or Telix, then those packages dictate the cabling requirements. The only thing you can guess reliably is the SG, TD, and RD. The DTR/DSR is also fairly common. There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here. And that is flow control. In the RS-232 scenerio, the DCE's are responsible for flow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over-run the DTE. By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted, the DCE will send data - without requesting permission first. Note the contrast to the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by asserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can send. And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio, the question is do you need flow control? The answser is usually. But how? For non-binary communications, one common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no wires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF commands. This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware flow control, but the problem is that you can't send binary data because your data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol signals. (A work around is to have the software insert and extract "escape" codes, but the hardware flow control is prefered). The problem with hard- ware flow control is that there is no standard. There are lots of ways to do it and I bet they have all been tried. One cornerstone of all the methods is to use the RTS/CTS for one direction. But beyond that anything is fair game. Again, you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements. But I bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage. By the way, I am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control the RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve, the CTS is the clear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve. This does not mean a differnt cable - it is just software. The clincher to all of this cabling stuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS signal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support- ing it in software. For these cases you will find cables that short the RTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS). Other possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain signals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it would mean additional wires). Specifically I am talking about the DSR. Shorting the DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like this. It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose. One more "gotcha" signal is the DCD. Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to see the DCD before it will work. This signal sometimes gets shorted with the DTR. But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end, but the RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD. And of course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must pass through. This null modem works with most software. The flow control, if any, can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR. If your comm. package does not specify the cable required for PC to PC connection, then I suggest you use this one.

Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off, and if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the CMOS data). Try replacing the battery. If, however, your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power the CMOS, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a more normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible, make sure you leave your PC on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor charged. I'd opt for the battery change, though. It's also possible, but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is corrupting the CMOS. If your battery seems okay, get a virus scanner and check out your system.	2

This is a fundamental aspect of Novell's business; they wouldn't be where they are if they didn't live up to their "Novell Does Printing" slogan. We run 6 printers of varying types off our Novell network; I'm sure there are places with hundreds.

You can get SCSI and IDE to work together, but there are restrictions (at least with the Adaptec 1542): * You MUST boot from the IDE drive. There is no way to boot from the SCSI drive if you have both IDE and SCSI drives. * You MUST disable the SCSI ROM BIOS (I'm not sure about this, though), and so you must also use some special drivers to access the SCSI drive. (Hmm. I know that you have to disable something related to the SCSI BIOS, but I'm not sure if it is the ROM itself.) Back in February, someone asked about IDE and SCSI (this question gets asked again and again). At the end of this message, I've included an edited copy of my reply. You might find it interesting. -- Darryl Okahata Internet: darrylo@sr.hp.com DISCLAIMER: this message is the author's personal opinion and does not constitute the support, opinion or policy of Hewlett-Packard or of the little green men that have been following him all day. =============================================================================== > 1) Is it worth it to get SCSI over IDE? Will there be a noticable > decrease in access time/increase in Xfer rate? For MSDOS applications, ISA-based SCSI and IDE controllers generally have comparable throughput. You might get slightly higher throughput with a SCSI disk, but you'll also pay more for the disk ($30-$100 and up, in some cases). You'll also pay much, much more for a good SCSI controller. Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if they're used with a good multitasking operating system (like a PC Unix). Unfortunately, neither MSDOS nor Windows 3.1 is a good multitasking operating system. The performance advantage of SCSI controllers is mostly wasted with these, which leaves the advantage of being able to connect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage. However, note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices. If you're only going to be using MSDOS, stick with IDE. It's cheaper, and you'll have less headaches. > 4) Will virtually any SCSI device chain into the controller for my > hard-drive (bernoulli box, CD-rom, Tape Drive, etc). [ Note: the following is true for MSDOS/Windows only. Who knows what the future holds for Windows NT and Unix??? ] No. Generally, you have to find drivers for each SCSI device, which probably don't exist unless you're using one of the "better"/"high performance" SCSI controllers. These are typically bus-mastering SCSI controllers that cost around $180-$400 (street prices) and up, and drivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular name-brand SCSI devices either come with the card, or can be purchased (for under $100 list price). Examples of such driver kits are: * Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit (list: $75). This works only with Adaptec SCSI controllers. * CorelSCSI! (from the same people who make CorelDRAW!) (list: $99 (?)). This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card that has an ASPI driver, like the Adaptec. Central Point's PC Tools for DOS 8.0 supports a number of SCSI tape drives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives). Unfortunately, it works only with Adaptec controllers. > 5) Are there likely to be other problems/incompatibilities with a > SCSI controller and sound cards/video accelerators/and similar > equipment. Yes, you will run into problems, if you're using a high-performance, bus-mastering SCSI controller. This doesn't sound right, doesn't it? It's true, though. With one of these controllers, you'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound cards, floppy-controller-based tape drives (like the CMS Jumbo 250), and Windows 3.1. I know. I've been to h*ll and back getting my SCSI controller to work with various hardware/software (thank God for tape backups). If you want a copy of my "Adaptec 1542 hints and tips" file, send email. These problems aren't really the fault of the SCSI controller card; the problems are really with the general hardware and software design of the PC (e.g., no standards). However, adding a bus-mastering SCSI card is what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible. SCSI holds a lot of promise, but you can run into a lot of PC compatibility problems. If you're planning on using only MSDOS/Windows 3.1, stick with IDE. If you want to use Windows NT or a PC Unix, you'll have to make some hard decisions: a good SCSI controller and more than one SCSI hard disk will probably give you excellent performance, at the possible cost of MSDOS compatibility. [ I say, "probably", because, while I know this to be true with a PC Unix, I don't know if this really will be true of Windows NT. I suspect that it will, but I don't know for sure. ]	2

Originator: kruckenb@peruvian.cs.utah.edu Organization: University of Utah CS Dept Lines: 53 FOR SALE: AT&T Dataport Internal 14.4K Fax/Modem The modem is an internal AT/(E)ISA 8-bit card (just a little longer than a half-card). It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax, v.42, v.42bis, and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression, so you can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phone line. They will "fall back" to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even disable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to connect with slower and older modems. It has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with multi-tasking operating systems (Windows, OS/2, Unix, etc). They use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI) which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and cleanest connection possible. These modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech support (and the call is free, too) from AT&T. They also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the NEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which will let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows application just by printing. The Windows version will send faxes of any font and can include graphics, etc. The DOS version can fax graphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so, as well as any HP Laser II resident fonts). I'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax). This is at or below the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an equivalent modem (including Zoom, US Robotics, etc). And, it is backed by a company that will never go away. This price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of downtown SLC. I can also arrange shipping, or you can stop by my home to pick it up. (If you're concerned about installing an internal modem, let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including installation.) If you're interested, please let me know. This is an excellent modem at an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for about ~$300). I installed one of these last week and it is very nice. If you have questions about this, AT&T has an info number at (800) 554-4996, or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them. The modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week.

They're very recent, I downloaded them from the Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there, email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well. I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them). I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on Cirrus's part but I don't think so. From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons (also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the following for the sake of comparison: Wintach Winbn3.11 Word Sprsht Cad Paint Overall Steve's system: 486/33 VLB: ATI Graphics Ultra Pro 9.33 10.34 20.78 8.28 14.90 13.58 my system - 486sx/33 VLB: VL24 Bitblaster 9.88 8.65 11.71 18.84 15.40 13.65 Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review. Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s, I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at least that was what the program said. Oliver Weatherbee oliver@earthview	2

Article-I.D.: adobe.1993Apr22.183309.25247 Organization: Adobe Systems Incorporated Lines: 28 X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9] A couple of months ago I tried out a Hercules Graphite card. A pretty nice board. Fairly fast, and seemed quite compatible -- even seemed to handle the SVGA modes I have whined about here on occasion. At the time I was just buying a VLB system, so after checking out the card I sent it back. I wanted a VLB card, and purchased a Fahrenheit VLB card. This card is fairly fast, will do 70 Hz refresh at 1024x768, but is not compatible with my CD-ROMS (the SVGA thing -- I think; I have merely conjectured that is the cause of an old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those programs than the modern boards I have tried. I have not gotten a straight answer out of anybody...). The monitor I am using it with is a 17" Magnavox, which also tops out at 1024x768x70 Hz so its really a pretty good match. But... That is for my wife. I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 for myself, and am looking for a graphics card to drive it. I want > 70Hz refresh, and would really like it to handle my CD-Roms. I tried the Orchid P9000, which did neither of those things (though Robert at Wietek did say that the >70Hz was possible if I modifed the driver data base). So my thoughts go back to Hercules. They were supposed to be coming out with a VLB version of the Graphite around the end of March. I have heard precisely ZERO about it since then. Does anyone know if the card was actually released, and what capabilities (and price) it has? Any info would be most appreciated. Geoff Sherwood	2

I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to : develop the first MDs for the computer. My question is: why isn't there : any substantial interest in developing the flopticals? Certainly in the UK the 21Mb flopticals are about the same price as a cheap CD-ROM now (you seem to be able to get them for around GBP 200-250). However the bigger optical drives (e.g. 128Mb) are much more expensive - around the GBP 1000 mark. A couple of questions that someone may be able to answer - the 21Mb flopticals - are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or do they need driver software etc. I.e. do you just rip out the floppy drive, plug the same cables into the floptical, stick in a flopti-disk and hey presto you have a 21Mb floppy. This sounds far too easy. On the subject of Sony developing MDs for computers, I have reread a PCW article on this subject and there it says that Sony have been doing optical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a product themselves. From the article it seems that the audio MD format is a byproduct of their computer storage work - the MD mechanism is identical to their MO computer optical drives. A Sony spokesman was quoted as saying that a 2.5" MD disk would hold about 100Mb of data though he refused to comment on any possibility of this being productized. The article said that one of the problems holding back development in this area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2 distinct optical storage mechanisms around at present. Given that it probably needs MDs being used as a distribution medium to get it into the market and since this has already been cornered by CDs it probably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting lead to get MDs accepted. -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- david shepherd: des@inmos.co.uk tel: 0454-616616 x 625 inmos ltd, 1000 aztec west, almondsbury, bristol, bs12 4sq "They didn't like the rates, they don't like the poll tax, and they won't like the council tax." - Nicholas Ridley	2

My >computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone. Running MS-DOS or a derivative OS, obviously. Please take note that the following is not what exactly happens, but a slightly simplified explanation. Technically, the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printer adapter, SoundBlaster, modem, hard disk, ...) to signal the CPU that "Something's happening here, please take note." How the CPU is programmed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system. In MS-DOS, the "interrupt vector" is used to store the address of the function that handles each interrupt. Now, basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready to print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt. When DOS prints, it looks at the LPT buffer. If there's a character there, wait a while and check again. If there's not, copy a new character to the LPT port. Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt, it's free for use for any other adapters - in this case, the SB. With any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS, this kind of printing approach just doesn't work (or more precisely, it wastes a lot of CPU cycles.) Hence, you can't "share" the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you're running Unix or OS/2 or whatnot. Another issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses interrupts. When the SB plays plain music, the CPU simply tells it what to play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt is required to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is needed. You can, however, hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt, but use them only one at a time. This is because the interrupt handling routine is same for both ports, and it can see from which port the data came from. This, of course, applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well. Remember, this was greatly simplified in parts, but I think gives the general picture correctly enough.

To put it a little differently: - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity. - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7; it uses other means to determine when it's time to send out another byte to the printer. - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between the ISA pin and the associated driver. Other adapters control the IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it in the high-impedence mode. - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't assert anything). The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically disconnected by a jumper. (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired. If that were true you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines, and that certainly isn't a requirement.) - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2, NT (?), various Unices or whatever the proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance reasons. And the SB16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers. Joe Morris / MITRE (jcmorris@mitre.org)	2

Think! It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks... The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices it is attached when it wants to. An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the SCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to start transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the bus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data. On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked the data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time. > > Also, I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book, > but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93): > > "The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board > direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers." > I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter. > So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT > HDD controller doesn't!?!?

The CPU performs the data transfer with a string move instruction. This requires that the CPU stop what it had been doing and transfer the data. Only the smart drive controllers, be they IDE or SCSI, can transfer via DMA. These controllers tend to cost the same wether they are IDE or SCSI. To get the DMA benefits, IDE must sacrifice it's price advantage *on the controller*. >> For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is >>issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other >>devices on the bus.

Floppies aren't on the IDE bus, your arguement makes no sense, this isn't an IDE issue. The floppys have their own processor on their controller board which handles all of these commands. The difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are intelligent. They each have their own controller. They depend on the CPU to do fewer things for them, i.e. IDE drives needing a processor to transfer their data. >>Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which, >>thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.

The dettach/callback mechanism alows the CPU to make requests of the devices on the SCSI bus and then dettach and go about its business. Later, when the device is done, it issues a callback to say that the data has arrived or the function has completed. Most SCSI cards will also DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU, therefore allowing it to continue working uninterupted. IDE supports no such concept as dettach/callback. Can you see how this would be a win in any multitasking system? --David Willmore -- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- willmore@iastate.edu | "Death before dishonor" | "Better dead than greek" | David Willmore | "Ever noticed how much they look like orchids?

I have never heard of anyone that had to return something in the 30 grace peried that had a problem at all with Midwest Micro. They may of thought that you didn't know what you were doing and suggested how to correct the problem. But it sounded as you didn't give them much of a chance to correct things at all. The fact that the PPI worked okay for you is because it is setup more for the no nothing user that can't understand the instruction and the commands to configure it to his/her system. When you find out things like the fact the the EC led that looks like you have connected to another EC modem, doesn't realy say that. But that it only tells you that you have EC turned on, on your modem. I think that these LED are nothing more that just light to hype up the product. Just like I bet someone took home a few extra $$$ in the last year for giving the PPI modems the PC-Magazine award of the year. Not so for the stash (12) of them that I saw on my test bench. I could go on for hours at no end as to all of the problems that I found with the PPI modems but I will try to control myself. I will not even go into the 6 weeks it took PPI to credit my card back for the modems after they had received them back...no I will not go into that one nor will I go into talking to the parent co. co from Hayes.

I am trying to use the 640x480x16M mode under unix (so i cant just call int 10h)I have a program which dumps the contents of the card registers under dos, but I am not sure I trust it for the extended registers of the et4000. Anyway, the problem is that in this mode, the Horizontal Total Register (3d4h index0) is apparently set to 0x27, but 3d4h index 1 (the displayed clocks) is set to 0xEF, so 0x27 is nonsense. A resonable value would be 0x0127 - so is there a high bit, and if so, where is it? Also, how does one set the video dot clock to the appropriate frequency ( and what would be an appropriate frequency?). The documentation isn't really very clear (tseng.txt from vgadoc2.zip from some ftp site) about this. My card is a MegaVga/1024 1Mb card. Seems to have a Tseng Labs Bios (ver 8.05 I think.) Works nicely under dos, and very well under unix (linux) in all the non-hicolor modes. Great for running X-windows in up to 1152x900x256ni - if your monitor will take it (only just in my case). Please email the answer, as I can't read news very often. Thanks very much, David	2

The second part is posted to comp.sys.mac.system and features many questions about system software. The third part is posted every two weeks in comp.sys.mac.misc. Tables of contents for those two pieces are included above. Please familiarize yourself with all three sections of this document before posting. All pieces are available for anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu (18.172.1.27) in the directory pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh. Except for this introductory FAQ which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as general-faq.Z, the name of each file has the format of the last part of the group name followed by "-faq.Z", e.g the FAQ for comp.sys.mac.system is stored as system-faq.Z and the FAQ for comp.sys.mac.misc is stored as misc-faq.Z. RTFM stores files as compressed (.Z) BINARY files. If you leave off the .Z at the end of the file name when "getting" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file before sending it to you. You can also have these files mailed to you by sending an E-mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the line: send pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh/"name" in the body text where "name" is the name of the file you want as specified above (e.g. general-faq). You can also send this server a message with the subject "help" for more detailed instructions. ==================== I HAVE A QUESTION... (1.0) ==================== Congratulations! You've come to the right place. Usenet is a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions (How do I lock a floppy disk?) to queries that would make Steve Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror. (I used ResEdit to remove resources Init #11, WDEF 34, and nVIR 17 from my system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string #A67B45 as a patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box would be a nice shade of mauve. Everything worked fine until I installed SuperCDevBlaster, and now when I use the Aldus driver to print from PageMaker 5.0d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs. P.S. I'm running System 6.0.2 on a PowerBook 170.) Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume, we ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the table of contents for the other pieces of it, check any other relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2, especially the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups, and RTFM (Read the Friendly Manual) before posting your question. We realize that you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen of your newly-installed twenty megs of RAM, but this question has already made its way around the world three hundred times before, and it's developing tired feet. Finally, before posting to any newsgroup (Macintosh or otherwise), please familiarize yourself with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup news.announce.newusers. HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT? WHERE CAN I GET IT? (1.1) comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces, a general introduction which you're reading now, and specific lists for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc. FAQ lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted, comp.sys.mac.apps and comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development. When ready each part will be available in its respective newsgroup. All pieces are available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory. Except for this document itself which is named general-faq.Z the pieces are named as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover followed by "-faq", e.g. system-faq.Z, misc-faq.Z. The .Z means the file is stored compressed so you'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use either MacCompress, StuffIt Deluxe, or the UNIX uncompress command to decompress it. However if you leave off the ".Z" extension when you "get" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file before sending it to you. This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned newsgroups. The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to get at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere else in the FAQ even if you don't have the other parts at hand. It's not always obvious, especially to newcomers, where a particular question or comment should be posted. Please familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh newsgroups before posting in any of them. Which questions appear in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong where. To jump to a particular question search for section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses. For example to find "Where can I FTP Macintosh software?" search for the string "(2.1)". To jump to a section instead of a question use a zero for the question number. WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE? (1.2) comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system. Four other files are worthy of particular note: Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup comp.sys.mac.programmer. It's posted to that group weekly and available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in /pub/mac. Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq (where the file you're reading now is also irregularly archived). This list answers many frequently asked questions about networking, UNIX and the Mac, telecommunications, and foreign file formats. Norm Walsh has compiled an excellent FAQ for comp.fonts that answers a lot of questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform conversion and printing. It's available in comp.fonts or by ftp from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/FAQ*. Finally Jim Jagielski maintains a FAQ for comp.unix.aux covering Apple's UNIX environment, A/UX. It's posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux and news.answers. It's available for anonymous ftp at jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov. WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO? (1.3) There are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones. You wouldn't ask your English teacher how to do the definite integral of ln x between zero and one, would you? So don't ask the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft Word is in the background. Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an excuse. If you want people to help you, you need to learn their ways of communicating. Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too :-) ). Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering silence. For instance the most common and glaring mispost, one that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic, asking a question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm, normally produces no useful responses. Posting the same question to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few network software designers. Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup. Do not cross-post. If a question isn't important enough for you to take the extra minute to figure out where it properly belongs, it's not important enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading. For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a catch-all newsgroup. The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs where. Specifically questions about productivity applications (software you bought your Macintosh to run, not software you bought to make your Macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup. Communications programs, games, HyperCard, compilers and databases all have more topical comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups. Post questions about non-communications hardware including questions about what software is necessary to make particular hardware work to comp.sys.mac.hardware. Questions about MacOS system software belong in comp.sys.mac.system. Questions about utilities and extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc. Questions about A/UX go to comp.unix.aux. Detailed questions about Appletalk belong in comp.protocols.appletalk. Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard. Non-HyperCard programming questions and questions about development environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer. ResEdit questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc, comp.sys.mac.system, or comp.sys.mac.programmer; but generally the netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking. A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY technical question about an application that actually begins to delve into the how's of a program as well as the what's (Recent example: How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly compare to other word processors written in high level languages?) might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup. For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac ONLY. We understand that you're desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to get the $$ for a PowerBook 180; but trust me, anyone who wants to buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted. Political and religious questions (The Mac is better than Windows! Is not! Is too! Is not! Is too! Hey! How 'bout the Amiga! What about it? Is Not! Is too!) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy. Anything not specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc. Finally don't be so provincial as to consider only the comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions. Many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems. Questions about Mac MIDI are often better handled in comp.music even though it's not a Macintosh specific newsgroup. Shop around. Usenet's a big place and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in comp.sys.mac. 4. SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF THEIR TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM. SHOULDN'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND WIT ON DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE? No. Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as frequent questions. Unless you really have something new to add to the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in System 7.1 could eat memory) private E-mail is a much better medium for answering common questions like this one. You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E-mail response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it before posting future questions. I do read all the newsgroups covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that lets me send PWFAQ's (people with frequently asked questions) the section of this document that answers their question with just the click of a button so please don't feel obligated to respond to someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they can't be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it. === FTP (2.0) === WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE? (2.1) The three major North American Internet archives of shareware, freeware, and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41), and wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4) which mirrors the other two sites and several others. Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove them for space concerns, and still has files that were deleted from the formerly important site, rascal.ics.utexas.edu. Rascal was notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives. Unless otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document should be available at the above sites. To keep traffic on the Internet manageable, Scandinavians should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), ftp.lth.se (130.235.20.3), or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead. Those in the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1). Continental Europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40), ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72), and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1). Australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au (139.130.4.6) which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive. Japanese users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp (130.69.254.254). A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3). This is Apple's semi-official repository for system software, developer tools, source code, technical notes, and other things that come more or less straight from Apple's mouth. Some material at this site may not be distributed outside the U.S. or by other sites that don't have an official license to distribute Apple system software. Please read the various README documents available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you're connecting from outside the U.S. or if you wish to redistribute material you find here. CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL? (2.2) The info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by E-mail from LISTSERV@RICEVM1.bitnet (alternately listserv@ricevm1.rice.edu). The listserver responds to the commands $MACARCH HELP, $MACARCH INDEX, and $MACARCH GET filename. Mac archive files are available from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu. Send it a message containing the words "help" and "index" (no quotes) on the first two lines of your message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files you may request. You can retrieve files from other sites by using the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com. For details send it a message with just the text "help" (no quotes). WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X? (2.3) If you can't find what you're looking for at one of the above sites, try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it an E-mail message addressed to archie with the subject "help." Archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15, America), archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3, the original archie server in Canada), archie.au (139.130.4.6, Australia), archie.funet.fi (128.214.6.100, Scandinavia), and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7, the U.K. and the continent). These sites index the tens of thousands of files available for anonymous ftp. Login as "archie" (no password is needed) and type "prog filename" to find what you're looking for or type "help" for more detailed instructions. For instance you would type "prog Disinfectant" to search for a convenient ftp site for Disinfectant. If the initial search fails to turn up the file you want, try variations on and substrings of the name. For instance if you didn't find Disinfectant with "prog Disinfectant", you might try "prog disi" instead. Substring searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross. To avoid many erroneous matches add a ".*\.hqx" to the end of the substring, e.g. "prog disi.*\.hqx" Most Mac software available on the net ends in .hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does. Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware. If you follow the above advice, you should almost never have to ask the net where to find a particular piece of software. CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X? (2.4) No. Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site. Please refer to the first questions in this section to find out about anonymous FTP, archie, and automatic E-mail servers. WHAT IS .BIN? .HQX? .CPT? .ETC? (2.5) Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to more easily pass through foreign computer systems. First they're compressed to make them faster to download, and then they're translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary (.bin) format that other computers can digest. (The Macintosh uses a special two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.) BinHex files are 7-bit ASCII text files, while MacBinary files are pure 8-bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary protocol. How a file has been translated and compressed for transmission is indicated by its suffix. Normally a file will have a name something like filename.xxx.yyy. .xxx indicates how it was compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated. To use a file you've FTP'd and downloaded to your Mac you'll need to reverse the process. Most files you get from the net require a two-step decoding process. First change the binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary (.bin) file to a double-clickable Macintosh file; then decompress it. Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table below. Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs will automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh files as they are downloaded. *************************************************************************** Suffix: .sit .cpt .hqx .bin .pit .Z .image .dd .zip .uu .tar Extractors -------------------------------------------------------------------------- StuffIt 3.0| X X X X X Compact Pro| X X Packit | X UUTool | X MacCompress| X SunTar | X X X X BinHex 5.0 | X BinHex 4.0 | X DiskDoubler| X X UnZip | X DiskCopy | X macutil | X X X X *************************************************************************** A few notes on the decompressors: StuffIt is a family of products that use several different compression schemes. The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff all of them. Versions of StuffIt earlier than 3.0 (StuffIt 1.5.1, StuffIt Classic, UnStuffIt, and StuffIt Deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 3.0. You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt Expander. StuffIt 3.0.5 (Lite and Deluxe) consistently makes smaller archives than any other Macintosh compression utility. To allow maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep net-bandwidth down, please compress all files you send to anonymous ftp sites with StuffIt 3.0.5. UUTool, MacCompress, and SunTar handle the popular UNIX formats of uuencode (.uu), compress (.Z), and tar (.tar) respectively. The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac products, so use them instead when that's an option. Translators that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also available by anonymous ftp. Macutil is dik winter's package of UNIX utilities to decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading them to a Mac. Since UNIX stores files differently than does the Mac, macutil creates MacBinary (.bin) files which should be automatically converted on download. It can't decompress everything. In particular it can't decompress the new StuffIt 3.0 archives. :-( However, if you need only one or two files out of an archive--for instance if you want to read the README to find out if a program does what you need it to do before you download all of it--macutil is indispensable. It can be found at sumex-aim in the info-mac/unix directory. A few notes on the compression formats: .bin: These are MacBinary files. Always use a binary file transfer protocol when transferring them, never ASCII or text. Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead. Only rascal stores most of its files in .bin format. Most communications programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance they'll be downloading MacBinary files. .image: This format is normally used only for system software, so that on-line users can download files that can easily be converted into exact copies of the installer floppies. Instead of using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies, you can use Steve Christensen's freeware utility MountImage to treat the images on your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive. MountImage has a reputation for being buggy, so you should have some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case. .sea (.x, .X): .sea files don't merit a position in the above table because they're self-extracting. They may have been created with Compact Pro, StuffIt, or even DiskDoubler; but all should be capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked. For some unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard designation for self-extracting archives created with their payware products SuperDisk! and More Disk Space. Instead they append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives. HOW CAN I GET BINHEX? STUFFIT? ETC.? (2.6) By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human being to copy them onto a floppy for you. If you're at a university there's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to give you a copy; and if you're anywhere less remote than McMurdo Sound, chances are very good that someone at a computer center, dealership, or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt. Once you have StuffIt (any version) you don't need BinHex. If you're such a computer geek that the thought of actually asking a living, breathing human being instead of a computer terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of protoplasmic jelly, you can probably download a working copy of StuffIt from a local bulletin board system. If you have religious objections to software gotten by any means other than anonymous ftp, then I suppose I'll mention that you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by far the hardest way to get it. Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and login. Type the word "binary." Hit return. Type "cd mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression" and hit return. Then "get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin" and hit return. Of course it's always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this fails look for something similar. If you've ftp'd straight onto your Mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double-clicked. If you've ftp'd to your mainframe or UNIX account first, you still need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac. Just make sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe is sending in binary mode. If you need more details on the last step, consult the FAQ list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software. HOW CAN I GET BINHEX, STUFFIT, ETC. FROM A PC? (2.7) You can't. There is absolutely NO way to get an executable Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp. You MUST beg, borrow, or steal the necessary software such as Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person. I realize this may terrify those among you who haven't left your parents' basement since you got an Apple II+ in 1980, but eventually you're going to need to link up with some human being other than your mother. (though I suppose if you're this much of a nerd you could send your mother out to get it for you.) While you're gathering your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world of daylight, please don't bother the net by asking this question again. There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh programs from a PC or other non-Macintosh computer onto a Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs. ================================================================= TROUBLESHOOTING: WHAT TO DO (BEFORE POSTING) WHEN THINGS GO WRONG (3.0) ================================================================= While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific problems, there are far more problems that aren't covered here. These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking for help. You should probably also perform the ten-step preventative maintenance routine described in section four, especially rebuilding the desktop (4.3) and resizing the system heap (4.5). Following these steps may or may not solve your problem, but it will at least make it easier for others to recommend solutions to you. IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM. (3.1) "Microsoft Word is crashing" doesn't say much. What were you doing when it crashed? Can you repeat the actions that lead to the crash? The more information you provide about the actions preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you. The more precisely you've identified the problem and the actions preceding it (Step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the following steps fix the problem. For example, "Sometimes QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error." is not nearly as helpful as "QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes when I link two text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already contain text." The former will leave you wondering whether the bug remains after a given step. The latter lets you go right to the problem and see if it's still there or not. READ THE READ ME FILE. (3.2) Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and bugs in their READ ME files. Often these aren't documented in the manual. Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound familiar. CHECK FOR VIRUSES. (3.3) Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk. Virus infections are rarer than most people think, but they do occur and they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do. REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES. (3.4) For half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields, improperly written software, the alignment of the planets) a file on a disk may not contain the data it's supposed to contain. This can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior. Restoring from original masters will normally fix this. REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE. (3.5) Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous. See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a clean reinstall. If the problem continues to occur after you've taken these steps, chances are you've found either a conflict between your application and some other software or a genuine bug in the program. So it's time to ISOLATE THE PROBLEM. (3.6) You need to find the minimal system on which the problem will assert itself. Here are the basic steps of isolating the cause of a system or application crash: a. Run only one application at a time. Occasionally applications do conflict with each other. If the problem does not manifest itself without other applications running simultaneously, you can begin launching other applications until you find the one that causes the crash. b. If you're running System 6, turn off MultiFinder. If you're running System 7, allot as much memory to the application as you can afford. Sometimes programs just need more memory, especially when performing complicated operations. c. If you're running System 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit addressing. There's still an awful lot of System 7 hostile software out there including some from companies that really have no excuse. (Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1, boys and girls? I knew you could.) Some of this software only expresses its incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken. d. Boot from a virgin system floppy. If the problem disappears you likely have an init conflict. You need to progressively remove extensions until the problem vanishes. Use a little common sense when choosing the first extensions to remove. If the problem occurs when you try to open a file, remove any inits that mess with the Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first. If the problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated, either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or, if you have a lot of them, perform a binary search by removing half of the extensions at a time. Once the problem disappears add half of the most recently removed set back. Continue until you've narrowed the conflict down to one extension. When you think you've found the offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem. CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT. (3.7) By now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why the conflict occurs. If a tech support number is available for the software, call it. If you're lucky the company will have a work around or fix available. If not, perhaps they'll at least add the bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release. ====================== PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE (4.0) ====================== You wouldn't drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a tune-up. A computer is no different. Regular tune-ups avoid a lot of problems. Although there are Mac mechanics who'll be happy to charge you $75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change, there's no reason you can't change it yourself. The following nine-step program should be performed about every three months. TRASH UNNEEDED FILES (4.1) Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a little time cleaning up your hard disk. If you're at all like me, you'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for applications you no longer have, archives of software you've dearchived, shareware you tried out and didn't like, announcements for events that have come and gone and many other files you no longer need. If you're running System 7 you may also have several more megabytes in your trash can alone. Throw them away and empty the trash. RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS (4.2) Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain. Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension in your collection. If you don't use the functionality of an extension at least every fifth time you boot up, you're probably better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes up memory, destabilizes your system, and slows down every startup. For instance if you only read PC disks once a month, there's no need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time. Cutting back on your extension habit can really help avoid crashes. REBUILD THE DESKTOP (4.3) The Desktop file/database holds all the information necessary to associate each file with the application that created it. It lets the system know what application should be launched when you open a given file and what icons it should display where. Depending on its size each application has one or more representatives in the desktop file. As applications and files move on and off your hard disk, the Desktop file can be become bloated and corrupt. Think of it as a Congress for your Mac. Every so often it's necessary to throw the bums out and start with a clean slate. Fortunately it's easier to rebuild the desktop than to defeat an incumbent. One warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments you've stored in the Get Info boxes. Under System 7 Maurice Volaski's freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments across a rebuild. CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only if Apple's Desktop Manager extension is also installed. To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and, as your extensions finish loading, depress the Command and Option keys. You'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild the desktop and warning you that "This could take a few minutes." Click OK. It will take more than a few minutes. The more files you have the longer it will take. If you're running System 6 you may want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop. If you're experiencing definite problems and not just doing preventive maintenance, you may want to use Fifth Generation's freeware init Desktop Reset. Desktop Reset completely deletes the Desktop file before rebuilding it, thus eliminating possibly corrupt data structures. ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK (4.4) All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950 contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk such as which disk to boot from. Unfortunately this "parameter RAM" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes. To reset it under System 7 hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys while restarting your Mac. Under System 6 hold down the Command, Option, and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the Apple menu. Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter RAM. Since you've erased almost all the settings in the General Control Panel, you should now reset them to whatever you want. The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the date and time; but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is notoriously inaccurate you'll probably want to take this opportunity to reset it anyway. RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP (4.5) Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most people still have at least half a row of icons march across the bottom of their screen every time they restart. All these extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of memory called the System Heap. If the System Heap isn't big enough to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of it, they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap, knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and trying to climb back on after they get knocked off. All this fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance and almost inevitably crashes the Mac. If you're using System 7, your Macintosh will automatically resize the system heap as necessary; but if you're running System 6 it's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage all your extensions and applications. By default this size is set to 128K, way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all. The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot blocks of every system disk. Bill Steinberg's freeware utility BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much needs to be allocated. If you're running System 6, get BootMan, use it, and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes. REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE (4.6) System files can become corrupt and fragmented, especially if you've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them. Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file corruption. I recommend doing a clean reinstall. Here's how: 1. Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks. 2. Copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out of your System file into a temporary suitcase. 3. Trash the System file on your hard disk. Also trash the Finder, MultiFinder, DA Handler, and all other standard Apple extensions like Control Panel and Chooser. These will all be replaced in the new installation. If you're running or installing System 7, move everything in the Extensions, Control Panels, and Preferences folders into the top level of the System Folder. 4. Rename the System Folder. Any name other than System Folder is fine. 5. Double-click the installer script on your System disk. Then choose Customize... Select the appropriate software for your model Mac and printer. You could do an Easy Install instead, but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don't need that waste your memory and disk space. 6. Once installation is finished, move everything from the temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System folder. If you're asked if you want to replace anything, you forgot to take something out in step 3. You'll need to replace things individually until you find the duplicate piece. 7. Reinstall any fonts or DA's you removed in step 2. 8. Reboot. You should now have a clean, defragmented System file that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable system overall. DISK UTILITIES (4.7) Much like system files hard disks have data structures that occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even causing data loss. Apple includes Disk First Aid, a simple utility for detecting and repairing hard disk problems, with its System disks. It's also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in the directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc. Even if you have an earlier version, you should get the latest version (7.1) from ftp.apple.com and run it on all your hard disks. Several companies have released payware disk utilities that detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid though, interestingly, none of them detect and repair everything that Disk First Aid does. The three most effective for general work are Central Point's MacTools Deluxe 2.0, Fifth Generation's Public Utilites, and Symantec's Norton Utilities for the Macintosh 2.0. A department or work group should have all of these as well as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do. For individuals MacTools ($48 street) is about half the price of Norton ($94 street) or Public Utilities ($98 street) so, features and ease of use being roughly equal, I recommend MacTools. All of these products occasionally encounter problems they can't fix. When that happens it's time to backup (4.7) and reformat (4.9). BACKING UP (4.8) This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be done a LOT more often than every three months. The simplest back up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies or other removable media. If you keep your data files separate from your application and support files then it's easy to only back up those folders which change frequently. Nonetheless every three months you should do a complete backup of your hard disk. A number of programs are available to make backing up easier. Apple included a very basic full backup application with System 6. With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder onto floppies. The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the Mac and MacTools Deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups. Finally if you're lucky enough to have a Tape Drive, network server, or removable media device to use for backups, you should check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux ($49 street, doesn't support tape drives) and Diskfit Pro ($74 street). There are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD Backup from System 6. DISK DEFRAGMENTATION (4.9) As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free space in the same place to write large files. Therefore the operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be stored in different places on your hard disk. As files become more and more fragmented performance can degrade. There are several ways to defragment a hard disk. The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your files, erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while you're at it. See question 4.10.), and restore all the files. A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place, i.e. without erasing it. Although the ads for all these products brag about their safety, once you've bought the software and opened the shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before defragmenting it in case something does go wrong. There are NO freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don't annoy the net by asking for one. REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK (4.10) Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use, so a hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data. You don't need to reformat every three months; but when your system is crashing no matter what you try, reformatting is the ultimate means of wiping the slate clean. Reformatting your hard disk may even gain you a few extra megabytes of space. Not all hard disks are created equal. Some can hold more data than others. To facilitate mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks (* 81.3 megabytes is the average formatted capacity. Your mileage may vary.) Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator of drive capacity. When you reformat there's no reason at all not to reclaim whatever unused space Apple's left on your disk. Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to initialize them. Most hard disks come with formatting software. Apple's disks and System software ship with HD SC setup, a minimal disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY. Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with their hard drives. Normally this will be all you need to reformat your hard disk. A number of general-purpose formatters are also available which go beyond the bundled software to include features like encryption, password protection, multiple partitioning, faster disk access, System 7 compatibility, and even compression. Two of the best are the payware Drive7 and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition ($49 street for either). While there are one or two freeware formatters available, none are likely to be superior to the ones bundled with your hard disk. PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter what software they use. Otherwise disk corruption, crashes, and data losses are a very good possibility.

2	From: albert@tornado.seas.ucla.edu (Albert E. Chou) Subject: Re: Good APS experience Organization: School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, UCLA Lines: 31 I thought I'd share a good experience, too. I bought the APS Quantum 240 zero footprint drive in May '92 (back when they still used two separate LEDs on the front panel and the case was metal). While traveling with it (it was in my SE/30 Mac bag, on top of the Mac) this past winter, one of the plastic tabs holding the front panel on broke, so that the right side of the front panel was coming forward away from the rest of the drive. I lived with this situation until it became completely intolerable (which more or less coincided with a network shutdown at school and a trip out of town I had to take, which gave me some dead time during which to have the drive sent out). I called APS for an RMA # and got one, with no questions asked about how the tab got broken (it was handled a little roughly by airline baggage handlers -- though nothing else was damaged [well, except for the internal speaker in my modem, which wasn't that well glued down to begin with] -- yeah, yeah, I'm never flying with my SE/30 again). And when I called back to ask whether I could send it in a little later rather than right away, they had no problem with that -- even when I exceeded the normal valid period for an RMA # by a day (they're usually good for 10 days). The front panel was replaced under warranty, and the drive was shipped back quickly (I mailed it first class insured on a Saturday by noon from L.A. to Missouri, and it came back by Fed Ex by Friday [I don't know exactly what day it came back because I was traveling that week from Wednesday afternoon to Sunday afternoon]). The only thing that could've been bad was that the first service rep I talked to, in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data, suggested that I take the drive mechanism out and send just the case. Unfortunately, I discovered the day I was mailing the thing, that would necessitate breaking the little seal and thus voiding the warranty! Oh, well. Al albert@seas.ucla.edu	3

Callbacks are very reliable, I found them 100% reliable, even under System 4.1. I was doing continuous background sound with interrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V documentation. You probably were cancelling your callback commands out of your channels, of course you didn't get called. In general, if you have problems with sounds working when you play one per channel and then close the channel (with the related slowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't work, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a channel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be because you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds have this command at the start of them. You need to resedit the sound and remove that command, then when you create your channel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the channel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you want. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you are going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks. Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the sound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses it. And it works great. If Spectre can spare the CPU time, you can too. One little disclaimer: There are some out there who say the Sound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right. I'm not sure either way, but I know for sure that you can make your sounds work 100% correctly on every other machine using the Sound Manager. -Steve	3

Reynolds" <jpr1@lehigh.edu> Subject: When you're not using it, turn it off! Date: Mon, 22 Mar 1993 06:50:14 GMT Lines: 53 Research has shown that the majority of the time that the United States' 30 to 35 million personal computers are on, they are not actively being used. In addition, 30 to 40 percent are left running at night and on weekends. Computer equipment is now the fastest growing private-sector use of electricity. Computers alone are believed to account for five percent of commercial electricity consumption, and may account for ten percent by the year 2000. If you are one of those who leave them on after you're done, it would be a big environmental benefit if you would just TURN IT OFF when you're not using it. It only takes a second or two to do. Also, the majority of the power your computer uses is not consumed by the computer itself, but by the monitor. If you can't turn the computer off, then please just TURN OFF THE MONITOR. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has formed an alliance with computer manufacturers to promote the introduction of energy- efficient PCs that "power down" automatically when not being used and thus reduce the air pollution caused by power generation. These new computers will save enough electricity to power both Vermont and New Hampshire and save up to 1 billion U.S. dollars in annual electricity bills. Look for the special EPA "Energy Star" logo when you buy computers. They should be available in one to two years. According to the EPA studies, the energy saved will prevent CO2 emissions of 20 million tons annually, the equivalent of five million automobiles. Also, 140,000 tons of SO2 and 75,000 tons of nitrogen oxide emissions will be saved; these are the major pollutants responsible for acid rain. Please do your part ... be responsible.

Well the monitor is consistently the largest power drain on your electric bill when you are looking at your computer set-up, especially if you have a large (16" or greater) color monitor. Generally what I do is leave my Mac on all the time, except for the occasional resart or syetem crash, but I turn my monitor off each night before I leave my office.

I'm primarily looking at 128MB drives, although I might consider 256MB ones. When looking through MacWorld and MacUser ads, the prices for the 128MB drives seem to range from just under $1000 (for the DGR 128REM Portable, Magic 128MB Portable Fujitsu, or NuDesign 128MB from MacDirect) to about $1600 (for the FWB HammerDisk 130 and Mass Microsystems DataPak MO/128). Different drives use different mechanisms - MOST, Fujitsu, Sony, Epson, probably some others. My problem is that after reading the Nov 92 MacWorld and Apr 93 MacUser reviews of these drives, I'm still not sure what to get. So, I'm asking if anyone has had good/bad experiences with any 128MB M-O drive or can shed some light on the wide range of prices (is spending more really buying me much?), reliability of different drives, compatibility between them, or anything else I should probably know.

The LC can easily handle the SCSI transfer rate of the CD300. None of the current Macs, even the Quadras, support SCSI-2 unless you get a SCSI-2 Nubus Card.

I can produce similar artifacts. I am using a Centris 610 with an Apple 16" monitor. I got the 8/230/CD configuration, so there is on-board ethernet and 1 Megabyte of video ram. The effect only occurs in 256 color and 256 grey modes. Any vertical scrolling operation, whether with a scrollbar or, say, using vi and inserting lines, will produce a scattering of horizontal flickering lines on the screen. They do not persist -- each is visible for perhaps one refresh, and then that part of the screen is back as usual. They seem to always start at or about the 64th pixel from the left, and are maybe 512 pixels wide. This is certainly not preventing me from using my Macintosh ;-), but it does seem to be a sign of something perhaps grounded incorrectly in the video circuitry... I went ahead and called the Apple Customer Assistance Center, at: 1-800-776-2333, or 1-800-767-2775 (more direct?) The person who answered was polite :-). I also took the chance to complain about my mouse button sticking, and about the mac hanging on boot after a (hard - killed MacsBug) crash which left a CD in the drive.

I had reports that this Mac was having trouble formatting disks and by the time I got to it, the FDHD just would not respond although all other functions were fine. I checked the voltages on the DB19 external drive connector and pin 6 showed no volts with 7 and 8 giving 25volts unloaded. The power supply is an Astec and I sent it away for repair. With the power supply reinstalled, I now get the following error: With the internal FDHD connected, the Mac boots fine but on completion of boot cycle an alert displays "The disk is unreadable - do you want to eject it?". For every combination of response, the alert reappears within approx 2 seconds and this error is continuous. The FDHD does spin but there is no head seeking and the FDHD is incapable of ejecting the disk. This error sequence occurs regardless of whether there is a floppy in the drive or not. Pin 6 on the DB19 external connector shows 1.2V, pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V. With the internal FDHD disconnected, the Mac boots fine and works great (MacEKG reports no errors). The DB19 external connector now shows no voltage on pin 6 but pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V. Now, the internal FDHD may be fubar, but I have an apple 800K external drive that gives exactly the same symptoms as the internal drive when connected to either the external DB19 or the internal connector at J16 (after suitable surgery to the external drive). The voltages at J16 (with the internal FDHD disconnected) are as follows: PIN Volts PIN Volts 1 - 2 5 3 - 4 5 5 - 6 5 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 5 11 - 12 - 13 10.75 14 5 15 10.75 16 5 17 10.75 18 - 19 10.75 20 5 This machine has a SWIM which I don't think EKG tests.

Summary: sync problems on multiple boards Nntp-Posting-Host: merlin.cvs.rochester.edu Organization: University of Rochester, Rochester NY Lines: 61 We are having a problem with a Quadra 950 that has stumped a couple of techs sent to us by the vendor, as well as us :-) This Quadra is 'stuffed' with 64Mb RAM, 2Mb VRAM and some large disk (400Mb I think). What happens is that after a certain variable interval of time the video circuitry 'loses' vertical sync. It is quite apparent that the Mac CPU is still ok, and the problem really seems to lie with the video circuitry, since you can still save your documents, quit your aplpications, even pull down menus etc. (only the display is scrolling lik crazy, so it's pretty hard to hit menu items ;-) We had the original logic board replaced twice now, and the same problem has been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has varied. The first board had this problem every about 1hr, more often if the cache was turned OFF (yes OFF). This is the only symptom that is not obviously related to the video circuitry (after all the cache is on the CPU right?). The second board had the problem every about 10 minutes (we did not keep it, rather we put the original back), the current board we have has this problem a lot less often (has gone about a week without doing it, but did it twice within an hour yesterday). The technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty sharp and tried a number of sensible things (most of which we had previously tried ourselves anyway). These included: -swapping the RAM -swapping the VRAM -swapping monitors (3 different 13" Apple RGB and 2 16" Apple RGB) -swapping cables -disconnecting HD and booting from floppy -sacrificing various small mammals Here are some other facts: -when we put a RasterOps ProColor 32 on the NuBus, the problem is fixed (it does not occur with the internal video or the ProColor video out) -the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards that exhibit it in our lab -Apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards that they cannot find anything wrong with, and getting them shipped back as faulty according to us. Here are some speculations: -I bet that neither Apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that much RAM and VRAM on them simultaneaously, which may have something to do with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem (though we can reproduce it with just 4Mb of RAM, so this is probably a red herring). -the vendor's representative blames 'metal in your walls' - claims that our walls have metal in them which interferes with the Mac's operation. We have another 950 in the lab which works like a charm (though it's not in the exact same spot....) Please don't tell me this is probably it, I do not want to believe it. -it's probably not poltergeists, since they do not have badges to get past security at the entrance to our site.

No, multisession capability and double speed are two different thing. Its just that the newer CD ROM drives have both capability.

The 33 MHz Universal Powercache with FPU and adaptor can be had for about $500 (still not a bad deal). I believe the Powercard is one generation older than the Universal Powercache, and the one primary difference is that the Powercard is machine specific while the Powercache can fit into many Macs with the proper adaptor. Both cards are 68030 based. I'm not sure if the hardware or software with the Powercard is otherwise different from the Powercache (perhaps someone could enlighten me?).

Using the Sound Manager on a Quadra is very well, but using SM on any of the low-end machines doesn't simply work for a decent action game since it just steals too much time from the CPU. This is a fact. By writing directly to the hardware on an SE, it is possible to have 4 simultaneous channels of sampled sound (11kHz) for a cost of approx. 8000 cycles. Exactly how would you do that using the SM, pray tell? The correct thing to do is to use the SM on the machines that can carry that extra load using the SM means, and to write directly to the sound hardware on the machines that can't. It's not the politically correct thing, but from the developers' point of view it is.

Thanks for the enlightening post. Is there a Technical Note on this? The desktop machine I was referring to was actually not a Mac, but rather, any of various workstations that use the 68030@25MHz, such as old Suns or old NeXTs. I used to own a NeXT 68030 cube. But I will try rebooting without extensions to see what kind of a speed difference I get with my powerbook Duo. I did notice an extreme slowdown to unusability with a Mac Plus after installing system 7 on it. Why does the OS suck up so much CPU power? Also, you're right--software does make a HUGE difference. I have the misfortune of using MS-Works on my Duo. When editing relatively small (40K) files, cut or copy takes several seconds, often more than 6 seconds!! This happens with power cycling turned off. As usual, MS software is maggot-infested feces. I'm getting Nisus to replace it for my text editing. -Avery	3

So, the PB100 just does graphical output and terminal emulation (not too hard at all for it). It was a FABULOUS setup !!!! :) Weeee!!! (By the Way, all MATLAB software was on class accounts. I was also the TA for a class that used SIMULAB/SIMULINK. We had site-license and take-home, then-destroy later site-release licenses... No pirating there, incase you're wondering.... Great Program!!! ) Just like to add, whatever future system you get, you can almost never get enuff memory.... Buy it while it's cheap - that is buy it when you get the computer since it's usually cheaper than upgrading... I ALWAYS run out of disk space... But I have a syquest on the Mac IIsi, so I never worried about space before... Got several carts). -shishin "squish" yamada squish@endor.harvard.edu	3

You shouldn't have ignored the ZyXEL. It can be purchased with a "Mac bundle", which includes a hardware-handshaking cable and FaxSTF software. The bundle adds between $35 and $60 to the price of the modem, depending on the supplier. It is true that the modem has no Mac-specific docs, but it doesn't require much 'tweaking' (aside from setting &D0 in the init string, to enable hardware handshaking). For more information on the ZyXEL, including sources, look at various files on sumex-aim.stanford.edu, in info-mac/report.

Here's the story: (1) The IIsi *cannot* supply a VGA output. However... (2) Some VGA-type monitors can adequately deal with the video signal the Mac uses to drive the Apple 13 or 14 inch "high resolution color display"---i.e., Apple's own 640x480 mode. So, if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your IIsi, you need (a) an adapter that converts from the Mac DB-15 connector to the VGA-style high density DB-15 connector, *but* tells the Mac to use it's own 640x480 mode, not the VGA 640x480 mode, and (b) a VGA monitor that can deal with the higher bandwidth of the Mac 640x480 mode over the VGA 640x480 mode (which as I stated in (1) above, the IIsi cannot produce). As far as (a) above is concerned, contact James Engineering, Inc. 6329 Fairmount Ave. El Cerrito, CA 94530 510-525-7350 FAX: 510-525-5740 They can probably get you the right adapter. Remember: you do *not* want the run-of-the-mill Mac-to-VGA adapter, because it will try to have your IIsi produce the VGA mode, which it cannot (the computer will just fail to produce any video signal at all). Instead, you want an adapter that connects between the Mac-style and VGA-style connectors, but tells the Mac to use the Apple 640x480 mode. Sorry for the poor terminology available for describing this distinction. As far as (b) is concerned, make sure to get a monitor that can deal with a horizontal bandwidth of 35 KHz and a vertical retrace rate of 67 Hz. These are the spec's of Apple's 640x480 mode. For comparison, the VGA-standard 640x480 mode uses a 31.5 KHz horizontal bandwidth and a 60 Hz. vertical retrace rate. The monitor will probably need to have auto-synch'ing capability, as the Apple mode you'll be using isn't one of the set of standard modes in the PC compatible world.

It boots fine from a floppy, and I can mount the hard disk using SCSI probe, but I cannot get it to boot from the hard drive. I installed a new driver, so I don't think that is the problem. This poses a rather large problem. I only have 4 Meg of RAM, and I need to run Mathematica, which requires 5 Meg. I was hoping to use system 7 virtual memory so that I could run Mathematica. However, I can't run system 7 from a floppy, so I can't get enough RAM. Any suggestions? Thanks for your time-- Chrisw@yang.earlham.edu	3

How many wait states are in the memory system, etc? What kind of a data bus does it use? 32-bit or 16-bit? It's still slow when plugged into a DuoDock.

Now for those of you who are wondering just WHY your PC or MAC just crashed I can tell you I always thought it was the incompetent ass who wrote or designed the software. Well, I don't think that way anymore, especially with the results I have gotten with replacing BAD SIMMS in my own machine and others at work. The moral to this story is to MAKE SURE your memory is good. I would be willing to bet lots of you out there have SIMMS with either soft or hard errors on them and you don't even know about it, but every once in awhile those bad SIMMS just makes your life hell. I just got plain SICK of dealing with peoples complaints that thier machine just crashed and they lost thier work. In case your wondering, or if you haven't already guessed I work in an IS department. Service is a do or die perogative in this line of work, so the MORAL IS: HAVE YOUR MEMORY TESTED with a SIMM hardware tester...and NO I don't mean the simple little software programs that you can run in your machine. SIMMS are complicated little beasts and they needs special hardware to test them effectively.

There are two approaches: 1. If your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the monitor (most common) you can get a *replacement* power cord that will go from the monitor to the back of the computer. 2. You can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing power cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the computer. Both cost about the same (aprox. $5) and are available from many computer stores (clone dealers are usually better at having these things and at good prices).

When I got my lowly classic II, the options were 40 or 80M harddrives, and it was clear that buying another 40M of harddrive space would cost *much* more than the difference in price between the two config- uartions. There is an analogous break in the LCIII/80 and 160 prices, and you will not regret spending the extra money for a larger harddrive. Particularly if you ever wind up wanting to use SoftPC, which sets up a several-MB (up to 30!) partition, or if you are generating large files with DTP software, or if you might ever want to check out a mac unix-like os, like MachTen, having the extra space will be helpful. when you are pricing used IIci's, look at the harddrive size they come with, and how much it would cost you to add more storage down the road... (Might be a useful bargaining strategy even if you see no reason to go over 80M, though I must admit that I am such a packrat that within 6 months of getting my computer, I was backing up a lot of stuff to floppies that I rarely use to because I was running out of space, without having started using DTP stuff, softPC or trying any unix os!) -Peter bell@minerva.cis.yale.edu	3

Here's what I've thought of: The IIci has much greater potential for expansion, a la NuBus and greater memory capacity. The LC III would be new, under warranty, newer ROMs (is the IIci "32-bit clean"?), and would have sound input. I also like the "pizza-box" case.

I wonder how hard it would be (i.e. what it would add to the cost) to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than some amount of time. This is pretty standard in portable machines, and the same kinds of tricks could be played; spinning down disks, turning off screens, reducing clock speed, etc. The advantage of this over just turning the thing off would be 1) you don't have to remember to do anything and 2) the machine is still available over the network. The tricky part might be in defining what constitutes inactivity. Certainly, you don't want to wake up from sleep mode just because somebody pinged you, but you do want to wake up (at least the CPU) if somebody logs in via a telnet connection. I wouldn't worry too much about wasting electricity in the winter months; that energy is just getting turned into heat. It may not be as efficient a way to heat a building as the central heating plant, but it's not too bad. In the summer though, it's a disaster. Not only are you wasting that power, but you're probably also running the air conditioning to get rid of the waste heat. -- Roy Smith <roy@nyu.edu> Hippocrates Project, Department of Microbiology, Coles 202 NYU School of Medicine, 550 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016 "This never happened to Bart Simpson."	3

My question is will the FPU performance degrade will I put the 68882 on the PDS card socket instead of on the motherboard itself? Intuitively, the math co-processor should always be placed close to the CPU, but I am not sure how good Apple's so-called processor-direct slot is when it comes to throughout.

Nope. I keep my Mac running all the time since it also acts as a usenet node and exchanges mail and news every half hour (I run uAccess) and receives all my faxes. I do turn off the monitors hooked up to it. They produce more heat than I want - it can be warm in my garage office in the summer.

The problem with turing your computer on and off constantly is not due to the power surge at start up. It is due to thermal fatigue. You turn on your computer, it heats up, and everything expands. You turn it off, it cools off, and everything contracts. There is a limited number of cycles of this that any component can take before it fails. Modern electronics are much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors. In fact portable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep function that extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermal cycles that occur. As a rule of thumb, if I am not going to use my computer (and this includes the monitor) in the next 4-6 hours, I turn it off (I always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of the phosphor). I tend to think that with the pace of technical innovation in the computer industry you should be much less concerned with the fatigue life of your equipment and more concerned with how long your particular architecture will be supported by hardware and software vendors. :") Charles Kuehmann Northwestern University Steel Research Group	3

When I print from, say, MS Word, I see the message "Spooling to disk," but sometimes nothing prints. Checking my memory map thanks to Now Menus, I see that HP Backgrounder has not loaded. Restarting fixes this. It seems to me that HP Backgrounder is quitting unexpectedly, and that its status as "Multifinder NOT aware" allows it to do this without my being informed by a message such as "HP Backgrounder quit unexpectedly." Have you ever seen this problem before. There may or may not be a related problem. I have experienced problems in putting my computer to sleep. Choosing "sleep" from the Finder menu sometimes does nothing. Today on a whim I checked the memory map, and I discovered that HP backgrounder was not loaded. Restarted reloaded HP backgrounder, and I was able to put my machine to sleep as usual. Just a mere coincidence or is the HP backgrounder crash preventing my machine from going to sleep? Has anyone seen this problem? I'm seriously considering the purchase of a StylewriterII because of the poor quality of the HP software. Please send your answers directly to me and post to the net.

I believe that Apple, Sun and a number of other desktop machine manufacturers have agreed with the government to incorporate power-saving techniques; this is also something that governments in other countries are likely to require in the future, so expect to see it. This may include the ability for the system to fully power down the monitor, via a controllable power outlet, and power it back on automatically. (Is this a "sell" on screen saver software companies?) Goals for "idle" power consumption have been set at something like 30 watts for the system, not including the monitor (? don't quote me on this). Note that in many businesses, the savings will be substantial, especially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems. Sun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for the night would save the company (Sun itself) on the order of $1M per year. Putting other (and automatic) power-saving features in would probably have greater than double that value. Given that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and home computers on (getting faxes, automatically getting email, ...), building power consumption control into all machines has a potential to cut ~2% off the national power consumption, based on data I heard. BTW: when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving work, it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors with the power switch on front. There was some indication that monitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate lots of power cycling. This may only apply to the monitors we use, but might be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch in back.	3

You may want to check if they have any internal drives. BTW, an older version of GateKeeper (I don't recall which version), hung up my Mac when trying to access a photoCD or audio disk. I got the newer version which did mention a conflict with the Apple 4.xx CD driver.	3

For my home computer I have a humble MacLC with a 12" color monitor. The majority of my work is writing, therefore I would love to have a b&w portrait monotor conected to the LC. However, I sometimes do need the color monitor. My question is this; Is there a good (Cheap) way to hook up two monitors to my LC and is there anyone out there that has done this, how do you like it? Please respond here or to me directly. Thanks for your time, hope to talk to anyone soon! jerry salem jerry@slack.med.upenn.edu	3

Lines: 15 A local dealer is offering Mac II vi machines equipped with Kodak multi- session compatible CD-ROM drives for what seems like an attractive price: $1500. I've used many other models up to a II ci, but this would be the first I could have my own Mac. Is it safe to buy an about-to-be discontinued model such as this. I'd like to yank the CD-ROM drive out, put it in a housing and share it with my PC. Is this feasible? The only info I have on the II vi is that it is relatively slow (16MHz), has an 68030 chip with a math coprocessor. I want to add a non-Apple portrait monitor and use this machine for HyperCard stack design. Is this a good buy, or would I be wasting my money? I would appreciate some advice. Thanks!

Bhamani) NNTP-Posting-Host: flubber.cc.utexas.edu Originator: faceman@flubber.cc.utexas.edu Hello. I have a question (or two) about the serial ports for the powerbooks (specifically the 145 with system 7.0.1). Is there a difference between the serial ports on the powerbooks versus any other mac, say plus or ii?? I have heard, though not confirmed by apple that the serial ports have problems at high speeds. I also heard that sys 7.1's new power manager 'fixes' this problem allowing speeds just as any other serial port. My particular use is that I have a 6811 EVB board that I need to interface with my powerbook via the modem port at 9600 baud. Currently, we are interfacing using mac pluses. I set everything up just as in lab and nothing. In fact, the powerbook locks up. Can anyone help, inform, advise? I would appreciate it. I would prefer email since I don't read the news at all. I will post a summary if enough response is generated. Thanks. Faisal M. Bhamani faceman@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu ps.

The answer ot this question is an unqualified yes. You can use any old vga/svga monitor with a centris. You do need an adaptor (I use a Mac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the two machines. THe adaptor I have mentioned will convert a centris to a three row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor. NOW, the special interest disclaimer. The above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400 resolution. IF your monitor will sync to 56Khz horizontal the above adaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (I prefer this on my 1604s). THen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates. I would advocate calling James engineering because they seem to have a clue. As to the comment by the person who said don't bother calling Apple because they will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue. APPLE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A F**KING ASSANINE IDIOT FOR EVEN CONSIDERING GOING THIRD PARTY AND IF YOU WANT THIS TREATMENT WANTS YOU TO PAY FOR THEIR THECH SUPPORT LINE (the supposedly compitantly one) AND THEN STILL HAS NO FU***** CLUE. personal experience. also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers doesn't see to extend to Macs (Sony, Magnavox). In addition to this to find out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the sync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits (*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most favorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a specialized application video card).(i.e. "well you can get a resolution 1168x832 on this $5, 9" "super smelly sock" monitor that will let you display TWO FULL PAGES side by side. All you need is our reasonably priced "oder eater" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an ultra fast horizontal sync rate of SIX fast kilohertz and three Khz vertical.") Note: with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in video board using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the sides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as possible. Using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an inch. -A.	3

Organization: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lines: 30 NNTP-Posting-Host: alfredo.mit.edu Here's the scoop: For the past two years, I have been using an SE/30 with a Sony 1304s and a Lapis video card. This past month, I bought a Quadra 800 and am now using the Sony on it. My SE/30 has been shipped home to my father who is planning on getting an Apple 14" monitor (The Trinitron one). My question is this: What kind of power cord will he get with the Apple monitor. Does it come with two types? As I recall, one can hook up the power cord of an apple monitor to the back of a machine such as my Quadra 800. However, for my father's SE/30, there is no extra plug which allows use of the SE/30's power supply. He needs to plug it into the socket separately. So...does the monitor come with a cable that will allow him to do this? Will have to buy a different cable? IF yes, where can he purchase such a cable? or apple kind enough to provide both types of cables?

It had given us flawless service until last week. The problem: Someone in our lab has an old 512 that was upgraded a couple years ago to a Plus with an aftermarket SIMM/SCSI setup (Digigraphics "SIMMer"). the DB25 SCSI plug runs through the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a 26-pin rectangular connector. Well, this guy had removed the back from the machine, to put more memory in, and had disconnected the the SCSI plug. Since the 26-pin connector is symmetrical (not keyed) he may have reinstalled it upside down, essentially reversing the pins on the DB25. He came in and asked if he could try out our HD on his SCSI port (it had never been used). Naive fools that we are, we said o.k.. His computer failed to recognize the drive. Now, none of the computers in our lab will recognize it. We tried Disk Doctor, and it doesn't recognize anything on the SCSI chain. Could installing the SCSI upside down have wrecked the HD's driver board? The drive seems to spin up all right and unpark itself upon powerup. The events are too coincidental to attribute the problem to stiction. Any help greatly appreciated- James jak@fff.chem.utah.edu (NeXT Mail)	3

It sounded to me like they were having both hardware problems and software compatibility problems with the machine. He's not recommending the Centris 610 to anybody; he says to consider a Centris 650 or a IIvx. (Why he would recommend a IIvx over an LCIII I don't know, but that's what he said.)

I didn't realize that you were talking about an Apple division other than AppleUS. AppleUS, being the main division, is the one that contains what most people feel are the correct names and configurations for the majority of Apple customers, and it is generally assumed that you are talking about AppleUS when you just say Apple. At least that's how it has always been in this newsgroup. All other Apple divisions are, apparantly, free to change names and configurations if they feel like it. I know that Apple Canada does this kind of stuff all the time. It's not a mistake, it's Apple Sweden giving a different name to an Apple product other than what AppleUS calls it. -Hades	3

To recapitulate: Occasionally, every two or three hours or so, my monitor momentarily loses sync. The entire raster image bounces down about an eighth of an inch or so, then rights itself. This usually happens right after I close a large window, highlight a large area, or do something that radically alters the image on the screen. Sometimes, though, it happens with no provocation whatsoever. I have received a bewildering range of replies. At one extreme was a man, clearly quite knowledgable about monitors, who said that the problem was that the 13" monitor's power supply simply couldn't always keep up with sudden changes of the raster image; the rapid change from a largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor's power supply. There was no fix available, he said, because nothing was really wrong. (I guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that it had to be endured.) This seemed quite persuasive and I would have been tempted to adopt an attitude of stoicism, except for a reply from a 13" monitor owner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the Apple Service Technical Procedures, Volume 3, under the heading Jitter Correction. The section describes a fix involving the replacement of a capacitor, the adjustment of a potentiometer, or, failing that, the swap of a circuit board. I would be grateful for a discussion among those who have had experience with this sort of thing.	3

I like to leave my computer on if I think I'm going to be using it withing the next 2 or 3 hours, but I get sick of my Dad constantly coming up to me and asking "Why is the computer on if you're not using it?" I also wonder about my computer being harmed by fluctuations in voltage from other things (garbage disposal, etc.) Here are my questions: How much harm do voltage fluctuations cause? My computer does not share a circuit with anything big but our my light dims when a refrigerator comes on or the garbage disposal is turned on (whose doesn't?), and also when the washing machine does anything. All these things cause a drop in voltage which is harmful to a computer, right? I also notice the fan in my System Saver turning at different speeds. Is it safer to turn it off and back on when I want to use it or to leave it on? How much electricity does my computer use? I have an Apple IIgs (ne flames), with a Kensington System saver GS (1 electric fan inside), an AppleColor RGB monitor, and an EXTERNAL 3.5" HD (1 fan and its own P/S). How do I translate this into Kilowatt-Hours? Also, how much of this is used by the monitor? Does the monitor use considerably less juice when the screen is totally black but still on? Many computers spin the HD up and down constantly to save power. I always thought this was harmful to the HD and defeats the purpose of leaving the computer on in the first place (except portables). Is this true? Thanks for the Info. I think this will help lots of people. Stacy	3

I have attempted to gather as many case histories as possible to find some estimate of success and risk. The number of replies probably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that success rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24 machines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present. This is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with. Thanks to all who contributed to this poll. Issues: Speed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without add on cards. All reported machines were able to use 25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. Several Apple Nubus cards were in use. No machine with the Nubus adapter was able to go faster than 25 mhz. One wasn't even able to achieve 25 mhz with the Nubus adapter in place At speeds of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distorted and hi density floppy disk problems have been reported. Note: Unless specifically listed below, machines were not tested with a higher speed clock to failure. Hence, the 25 mhz operational machines may well work at higher speeds. Damage) One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad. This was repaired and the machine is operational. One other reported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator during desoldering. There is one second hand report of a user putting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron. No reports of static discharge damage. No reports of high speed operation causing damage. Then again, I also don't have any reports from users of defective parachutes. Add on boards) Compatibility appears to be a problem with Apple Nubus Adapters. Several other add on boards have been used with success. See case histories Heat Sinks) Virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed. These were often the TO-220 style power transistor type. Some used epoxy. Some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab of cyanoacrylate glue. There was also use of a clamp with a bolt through the hole in the motherboard. Case Histories: All speeds are the effective CPU speed (1/2 of clock oscillator). All reported CPU versions were 20 mhz. 1) 27.5 mhz operational. Ran for 10 minutes at 31 mhz before crashing. No FPU or other add on card Heatsinked CPU only On 24 hours/day No damage during installation 2) 27.5 mhz operational without Apple Nubus adapter. 25 mhz top speed with Apple Nubus card installed Heatsinked CPU only On 24 hours/day No floppy problems No damage during installation 3) 27.5 mhz operational.

Sean O'Casey in _The White Plague_ by Frank Herbert. Hmmm... that's not quite right. The Performa 600 is Real Darn Close to the IIvx (but a better buy IMO). I also don't think they are so much a 'low-cost business solution', but a low-cost _home_ solution. Why else bundle at ease (among other things)? Hardly a business application. What do you mean by 'no "retail price"'. Quite the contrary, I think. The price is darn near the same all across the country. That (again, IMO) was one of the selling points of the performas -- ie: no haggling required. Kinda like the Saturn (car) of the computer set. One price, medium performance, ready to go. When I shopped for my Performa (600CD), the difference between Sears (*sigh), Montgomery Wards, Silo (*sigh), Circuit City (*sigh*) and Bizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been $100.00. Why I chose one over the other was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who went the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someone who sells Apples?). Admittedly, except for Montgomery Wards (and I suspect I was just lucky) all of the salesfolk I spoke to didn't know didly about the computers, peecee or mac. But then, neither did any of the Apple dealers I spoke with... If you would've told me a year ago that I would buy a Macintosh from Montgomery Wards I woulda laughed for a long, long time. Go figure. I'm *real* happy with my Performa. Oh, and I bought the Apple Performa Plus monitor (vs. buying 3rd party). Happy with that decision as well.

I can't imagine that it would be cheaper to build an 8 MB SIMM using 1 Mb DRAMs as the 4 Mb parts reached (and exceeded) bit for bit price parity with the 1 Mb parts some time ago. It's probably possible to build a single-bank 8 MB SIMM using 4 Mb parts - this could cause problems in a Q800. I'm not sure why you'd want to do this, though, as a dual-bank 8 MB SIMM would be cheaper to build than a single-bank composite one. - Dale Adams	3

I've seen this sort of effect when a runaway program (which could be caused by an INIT conflict, for instance) accidentally wacks on a register in the video hardware. Have you tried booting with no extensions and then letting the Q950 just sit there in the Finder? You might also want to try changing to 24-bit addressing (yes, I know you can't access your full 64 MB of RAM - it's just an experiment) as the video hardware registers can't be accessed then. Another thing to try as a 'recovery' measure is to use something like QuickKeys to change the pixel depth of the display. This reprograms (some of) the video hardware registers and may allow sync to be restored. - Dale Adams	3

I love the Mac interface and any number of the features, but am sorely dissapointed with the speed. I use macs daily and am a Moc consultant for OSU Statistics department; I'm familiar with almost every model out there, and my experience is that both the Amiga and the Atari ST simply "blow the Mac out of the water" in terms of performance. At this time I would in general say that the other advantages of the Mac outweigh the advantages of the Amiga or the ST (and Falcon), but I really wish Apple would get their heads together on speed... :-((((( They could take a real lesson in muli-tasking from the Amiga OS or the MultiTOS in the Atari Falcons too :-((( > I'm still happy with my ci, but I don't understand why the performance is > so bad (comparatively). They could have done multi-tasking _properly_. > They could have done everthing else better -- but apple didn't. > (of course DOS 6 and windows 3.1 are nothin to write home about either!!) I just hope that someone comes out with a machine that does *everything* well someday. If I had my choice, I would go with Mac in most aspects, but add the speed and superior Multi-Tasking of the other platforms. As for the original topic; Trying to compare *just the chip* in a machine seems almost worthless. A fast 386 with a wiz-bang graphics accelerator will be faster in productivity for many applications than a even a stock Quadra. Add a graphics accelerator to a 486 and you *really fly*. Of course, add one the the Quadra and then you're blowing the 486 away... etc... > Oh well, y'all got $2.00 worth for the price of $0.02 I think mine was only worth $0.01....... ----------------------------------------------------------------------> |-! -David Butler- dhbutler@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu "This is not a novel to be tossed away lightly; it should be thrown with great force." -Dorothy Parker	3

The problem is that the Plus's poor old power supply (sometimes referred to as the analog sweep board) is on its way out. Apart from a board swap (bikkies to Apple), there's not much the average Joe can do to fix it. You can, of course, try and re-adjust the voltage levels (the 5v rail should be as close to 5v as you cn get it) but this is more often than not a temporary fix.

I want to be able to run Mathematica and would like to hear some comments from the gallery about this. How much slower does the program run on a machine without an FPU (namely a PB160) versus a machine with an FPU (namely a PB170). What types of calculations get bogged down the most. I primarily due moderately simple algebra, integrals which can be dealt with analytically and plotting including 3-d plots. I don't do a lot of numerical work. Would a PB160 with a lot of memory ( and the very nice video port ) be sufficient or should I really try to get an FPU for this type of work? Is a PB170 with 8Mb faster than a PB160 with 12 or 16Mb.

Apple will offer a miniature video camera that can be mounted above the user's monitor or moved about on the end of its cable to take pictures of objects or documents. Taking advantage of the 32-bit digital signal processor (DSP) built into the systems' logic boards, the camera will be able to put an image measuring 360 by 288 pixels, with 256 gray levels, on the screen. Users will be able to install supplementary lenses that can record detail as fine as the wire bonds on an integrated circuit. The camera is expected to cost between $150 and $250. The systems will ship with all the software needed to put Apple's Casper voice-recognition technology to work; users apparently will have to purchase an operational high-fidelity microphone. The two models will talk as well as listen. A new system facility called the Speech Manager will convert text strings sent by applications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer. The Cyclone will include a 40MHz '040, three NuBus slots and support for up to 128MB of RAM. The Tempest will use a 25MHz LC040, lacking an FPU, and hold up to 68MB of RAM; it will have a single slot that will require a NuBus adapter and have room for only 7-inch NuBus cards. Users will be able to update the Tempest's process but not the Cyclone's. For more get the 02.22.93 issue of MacWeek.	3

Two points which my cause problems are the 4 MByte Ram solder on the board. The are only 80ns Rams and run at the upperlimit with 33 MHz. The next part which may cause trouble are the Video Rams. I have the orignal 100ns VRAMs from Apple in my Quadra, here you are also at the upperlimit where most of the chips running but it isn't garantied to run. Most of the other parts on the Quadra board running on there o wn clockspeed so they wont make truble. The most importaned question is do I neat a new heat sink. I would say NO. After running my Quadra for more than 14 hours the heat sink is really cool. A 33 MHz 486 with heat sink is mutch warmer than the 68040 in the Quadra, so I didn't see any problems. The room temperatur was 22 Celsius (72 F). If you living in a area were it is hot 100 F (45 C) and your room temperatur is not mutch below I would suggest a new heat sink with a ventilator to stay on the safe side.

The reasoj I ask is that it seems the prices for SVGA are lower than >that of their mac counterparts... First of all, I wouldn't advise wasting your time with Apple. They'll treat you like an idiot and you won't get any answers (a personal opinion). The safest thing to do is match the SVGA monitor's scanning rates with Apple's rates. I don't know Apple's video scanning rates, but I use the Micron Xceed 30's rates, as they're a good approximation. About cables: you just have to go out to someplace like Fry's and get a few Mac-VGA cables and try them out. I have a ViewSonic 5E (14") and I use an NEC adaptor. Other monitors may use other adaptors. I also have a Mac->832x624 adaptor that tricks System into thinking the monitor is an Apple 16".

Nntp-Posting-Host: mac183.mech.nwu.edu Organization: Mechanical Engineering Lines: 32 In the last two weeks I have the following problem on two 160's 1 has a 8Mb Simm and the other a 6 Mb simm Both are about 2 -3 months old, bought from different vendors and installed by different people. Both computers begin crashing frequently, locking up and ultimately the Memory Chimes. Crashes would almost always occur if you moved the screen and sometimes would occur when you weren't even touching the computer. In both cases, taking the machine apart, taking the memory out and putting it back in solved the problem for awhile but then it would comeback, my marginally educated guess as to what's happening is that larger SIMMS are "lopsided" in that the insertion point is sort of a pivot point and after time they begin to move about - possible because of pressure on the keyboard or something? Anyway, has anyone else had such a problem or solution - If somehow you could support the other end of the simm to prevent it from moving. I've had no problem for the past 3 weeks by replacing my 8Mb simm with a 2Mbsimm -although this is NOT desireble solution. Please email any resp - and/or post if usefull to the rest of the world.

My school is discussing installing a Mac lab of 10 to 15 stations for our Bio 100 to 103 classes to do a study with pig disections. (no joke) Here is the deal. We can get this grant to do a study on if it is more feasible to do a disection via the computer or via the real thing. My problem is I was somehow drawn into this project (being done by students who want to go Mac but know NADA about them, being the man mac man on campus, guess who they came to?) so I wnt to know what would probably be the best hardware to fill the follwoing list? Right now we are looking at the C650 8/80 and the 2vx 5/80 platforms. Ok here it goes: We are using cd-rom, so ought we go with the internal Apple Cd-roms offered as options in the 650 and vx or go external. It is a matter of price and reliability, the second being VERY important. How much RAM? I was thinking 5-8 more leaning towards 8? What do you think? Ok, called apple educational discounts and they said their keyboard (extended) is 160.30. Is it better to go with the Apple and their long time great wear and tear record, or is there a 3rd party extended keyboard that is just a reliable? Price? Printers: One color printer we are presently leaning towrds the Thermal Wax Tektronic 200e or 200i (Probably the e as we are going to limit access so we don't needed the i's networkability) So, what do you think in terms of color printers? Different brand? Kind (Dye Sublimation? Ink Jet?) Price? Companies? 1800 #s? Also, we are looking to get a laser printer or such to network into the whole lab for noraml printing. The fornt runner is the Apple Pro650 (is that right don't have my notes here?) at 1650. Suggestions? We have kids using these things all day if this lab goes through and they know nothing about it for the most part. It has to be reliable, easy to maintain, and economical (ie, not high priced paper cartidges, etc). Finally, and this is my little dig into the Project. What about netting these things? We have ether nearby and I would like to slap the macs on the net, but, server? Individual ether? Forget about it it is going to be astronomically priced and the school is going to laugh at you when you ask them?

(I have seen similar ads for the IDE versions in IBM PC magazines) Well, the ad says that all three drives have a FAST SCSI-2 interface, but then it says that the DTR rate for each drive is 5 megabytes/second, *max*. How can this be? I thought that if a drive was to be FAST SCSI-2 it had to have a DTR of 10megs a second? (I am assuming the 5megs/sec claim by Micropolis is from the 512k cache. I admit that I would be very impressed if the drive can *read/write* data at 5megs a second!) Thank you.	3

The Duo's memory is faster than its equivalent desktop machine by 5-10% (and the rest of the powerboks). I think the explanation for this was that it can refresh faster (in 2 instead of 5 cycles I believe). Things that could affect performance would be factors such as use of functions enhanced in the FPU (which the Duo doesn't have undocked). Extensions and background applications can slow your computer down too. Real life differences in speed are likely to be influence by the software you are running, what kind of screen depth you are running etc. Espen PS! The Duo is 32-bit through-out.	3

Previously I had been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds. Your mileage may vary. The top speed you achieve cannot be predicted before hand. My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far. I didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher speeds. Parts Clock Oscillators (4 pin TTL variety) You will need a selection of speeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. The CPU will run at 1/2 the oscillator speed. The original one is a 50 mhz unit. I recommend getting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one. I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for less than $5.00 each. Some of their part numbers are: 50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X121) 62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X136) 66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # CTX137) Don't get the half size clock oscillators. They won't fit. There are also CMOS clock oscillators. I haven't tried one in a Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi's) Socket: Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket. Cooling Fan: A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up something similar or risk frying your CPU. Procedure 1) Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here. 2) Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from the back of the mac. 3) Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up. The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you need release. 4) Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard. The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed to release it. 5) Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount 6) Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful here. 7) Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case. 8) Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle, rear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release. 9) Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case. 10) Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plastic Power light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. The motherboard then comes directly out. 11) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillators must be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation. Very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some of the pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sure your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board. I used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This is NOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard is a multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without proper care. 12) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was. 13) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use the old clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside the socket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new 50 mhz clock. 14) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification. 14) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place. 15) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard. 16) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about 1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case. Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks into place. 17) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY DRIVE CABLE. 18) Replace the phillips head screw 19) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in. 20) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount. 21) Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn't, something is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck your handiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences. Hopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off and replace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot and be astounded. You will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding a particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-up might take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time since modifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a single problem. Good Luck to all who attempt this modification. There is a small but real risk, but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than $50 in parts. Guy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>	3

[ This would make me a bit suspect of Mr. Ramsey's qualifications as a self-styled "expert", in fact, when I read about anybody using virtual memory regularly I kind of wonder ... ;-) ] Yes, one can sometimes get away with running a newer ROM (of the correct size, obviously) in an older machine, but one should be prepared for problems if running software that checks for machine type rather than ROM trap availability and then draws incorrect conclusions when special-casing - especially timing-dependent and driver-related stuff. In this particular case I see no reason to go to the trouble of ROM-swapping. The Apple 32-bit enabler has problems, but MODE32 works just fine with 7.0, 7.0.1, and 7.1. >Does anyone know of a source for these ROMs? Sure. Buy a used IIci motherboard. Call Pre-Owned Electronics, Shreve, or other parts dealers (see the back of Computer Shopper or one of the Mac trades for phone numbers) and ask for a price on a IIci ROM. Everything has a price. If you happen to find somebody who salvaged a IIci with a dead motherboard, you might get a decent price. There is probably a market for used mother- boards as well, so they might sell a ROM anyway. >Needless to say, I'm interested in purchasing such a ROM. What would >be a reasonably price to offer? Ask for a quote and then try offering less? Pre-Owned and Shreve have been known to dicker. Their ads in various trade magazines often list considerably different prices for the same items, and their phone quotes tend to vary as well.

I put the HD floppy in my Superdrive to check that the floptical had formatted it correctly, and now my Superdrive refuses to recognize ANY floppy (it says "this disk is unreadable" and asks if I want to format it) even original systems floppies from Apple. Nor will it format the disks if I try to ("initialization failed!") Strangely enough the floptical still reads both the 21 MB and 1.4 HD disks, but I cant look at my 800k floppies, and if I have a crash I'm screwed because the Floptical can't be used as a start-up disk.

The opinions expressed are those of the user and not necessarily those of Oracle. Lines: 60 I recently corrected the resolution on my Sparcstation by changing /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers from: :0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 100 to: :0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 85 I determined that my 19" 1152x900 monitor was 85 dpi by measuring the active screen area and dividing by resolution. However, this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely. After some research, I believe this is caused by my applications requesting fonts by Family, Weight, Slant, and Pointsize. I believe that X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics and displaying it. Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my path, the results are inaccurate. I do have some Speedo fonts, but not for the family I am using (Helvetica). I think this is incorrect. The fonts should always be provided in the resolution of the display. This never seems to happen unless you explicitly request fonts by xres and yres! This is true of both the scaleable and bitmapped fonts! For instance, the command xfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*' Will invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a Speedo font). The command xfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*' Will invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path). Despite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi, and that it can generate an 85dpi font for me! Unless I my applications specifies a resolution, X appears to pick a stupid default. Is this a bug? Is it a feature? If so, why? Is there anything I can do to get around this problem? People have suggested that I lie about my resolution, and specify a single font path (75 or 100, not both). This would at least make my app consistent, but I like being able to look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: "Yup, thats an inch".

If you don't do this, the >cursor will be hard to track when in motion. You allways could port and use emu from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/emu.tar.Z. We've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned. You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal / ver- tical line cursors, smaller block cursors), turn on and off blinking, set the blink rate and so on. You even get blinking text - ok, enough advertising. I haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect, but from the memories I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do what we wanted (mostly the blinking text), I'd say it won't be easy, since xterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to X10). The actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you provide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned, you'll have to show the cursor directly after it has moved, or people will become confused. Since it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you do anything on screen anyways, this isn't very complicated. You'll just have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after it's mapped. As for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export is still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new release for over six months now, but unfortunately we're drowning in work. But since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much, I'd say whoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version. As is, emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else than a csh. There is a fix to this, which is very short (remove one line of code). I'll put this on export today.

The first sentence describing the bitmap resource in the MenuButton section of the "Athena Widget Set - C Language Interface" documentation states bitmap A bitmap to display instead of the label. One way round this might be to make use of the button's backgroundPixmap resource, but remember that you, or a user of your application, won't be able to set it from a resource file. Also, the button won't automatically be the size of the bitmap. The bitmap will be tiled if necessary, or you could set the button's dimensions to match its size.

I looked >twice at porting emu to linux, but stopped short becuse of the tty >part. Is there a `cleaner' version of emu that supports POSIX tty >explicitly? Hmm, depends on how you define 'clean'. Jordan implemented the system dependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for, call it, operating system types, then you go ahead and write a include file for your specific machine or operating system using the basic implementations. Since both Jordan and I haven't encountered a OS flavor yet, that is fully POSIX, we haven't gotten around to really implement (and test) a top-level include file specifically for just posix. The posix routines are used in the sun specific file tty_sun.i for example, but here we also use some bsd stuff. All in all it still is probably better to implement a include file for each and every operating system than '#ifdef'ing in existing ones. The type of mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm sources. Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a couple of times, this only uses up some disk space, since only the "drivers" actually included from the toplevel include file will be compiled into emu. It shouldn't be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fully relies on the posix stuff, but unfortunately I don't have a linux system available to me, so I can't do the port myself. I would suggest you read the README in term/sysdep and if you have any problems or questions, contact me and we could try to sort this out. Unfortunately we have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu, since we just don't have access to that many different systems.

Im having a problem I hope someone here can help me with. I create a window, and I want it to have some background color, say red, and draw an oval in it. Further, when I resize the window, I want to be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window (whether it is larger or smaller.) Im using AIXwindows on an RS6000. My problem is this: when I resize the window, only the "original" part of the window that was part of the window creation gets drawn into. Everything else is a grey..the oval "tries" to redraw itself but gets clipped. I can see that it WOULD be the right size if I could see all of it, but it only shows up in the region that was the original size of the window when created. For example, I start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. If I resize it to 400x400, the only part that has any color drawn into it is is from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey. Further the oval only shows up in that 200x200 area. What am I doing wrong?? How can I get a window to resize and redraw a re-scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window?

The significant change this time, and the justification for the hike in the major version number, is: o undo has been implemented. By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited, levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is supported. There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-) -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of what it is all about: aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant improvement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it features, amongst other things, o multiple windows o multiple buffers o default menu interface o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons under user control o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters o provision for defining a keyboard macro o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters o file selection via a browser o knowledge of line numbers o parenthesis matching o regular expression searching o restricted or unlimited undo o ability to change font o easy entry of control codes o xterm-like keymap feature o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources) o both brief and comprehensive on-line help o server mode with cooperating client programs o optional extension language using Tcl o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe I have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and Xaw3d options, on the following systems: Sun SPARC SunOS 4.1.x MIT X11R5 Sun SPARC SunOS 5.1 MIT X11R5 Encore Multimax UMAX 4.3 MIT X11R5 DEC 5000/120 ULTRIX 4.2 MIT X11R5 HP 9000/710 HP-UX 8.07 MIT X11R5 MAC IIci AU/X 3.0 MIT X11R5 but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have only tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first. A number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is provided for those systems that do not have one. Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been encountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under R4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known problems. Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If it doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release, 2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as many features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only that, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of aXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2 never got converted to make use of it. aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due course from several other ftp sites.

Subject: Bibliography -- books, manuals, journals, papers, beer-mats Subject: Getting this File, Revision History, Recent Changes Subject: Terminology: OPEN LOOK, OpenWindows, X11, XView, OLIT, MOOLIT, Motif @ What is OPEN LOOK? OPEN LOOK is a specification of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). A GUI determines the `look and feel' of a system -- the shape of windows, buttons and scroll-bars, how you resize things, how you edit files, etc. The OPEN LOOK GUI is specified, developed and maintained jointly by Sun Microsystems and AT&T (or USL?). See Also: Bibliography @ What is OpenWindows? OpenWindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface Specifications. It's compatible with the X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun's NeWS and SunView, so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems. It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors. OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews, after the program used to start it and the main executable itself, respectively. It should not be called `Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or `OpenLook', as these terms are either wrong or apply to something else. A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5,000 for the server, plus about $25,000 for DeskSet, and another $40,000 for ToolTalk. The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are: SunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0 Solaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0 Solaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1 See Also: Mixing X11 and OpenWindows Where can I get it? @ What are OLIT, XView and TNT? These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications. See the Bibliography for documentation on the individual toolkits. Here's a brief summary: OLIT was AT&T's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system; it used a widget set, and was probably the easiest for people who were already X11/Xt programmers to learn. You could buy the source from AT&T, although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship. Sun includes the OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in System V Release 4. It was written in C. The release of OLIT in OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0. OLIT support passed to USL (then a division of AT&T, now owned by Novell), who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.). Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing, you will probably want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or anything else that uses subclasses. [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference] XView is Sun's toolkit for X11, written in C. XView is similar in programmer interface to SunView. There's even a shell script to help migrate source code from SunView to XView. XView is often said to be the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows. The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows, and full source is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere). The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0. Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun. XView *will* be included in the next release of OpenWindows, unlike NeWS. On the other hand, the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much attention from Sun in the future as OLIT. The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based on the PostScript language and NeWS. TNT implements many of the OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of an application. It's currently included in OpenWindows. The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some incompatibilities with `tNt' 1.0 and TNT 2.0, but Sun are committed to supporting the API, at least until they stop NeWS support some time later this year and replace it with Display PostScript. Wail. You might ask what `is committed to' means in this context; the answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing. Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT, however. The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++ class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from DevGuide 3 GIL files. The UIT also includes features that simplify event management and the use of PostScript and color. It is said to be compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3, and presumably V3.0.1, since the release mentions that it works on Solaris 2. UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of various people within Sun. It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!). @ Where does Motif fit in? It doesn't :-). Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that is being developed by OSF. It has a `look and feel' reminiscent of Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager. There are no non- commercial Motif toolkits available, although the Motif source is sold reasonably cheaply by OSF. Although Motif is currently available on more platforms than OpenWindows, the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly used on many more machines, simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a large installed base. Sun's CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in the `Periodic Table' OLIT demo, $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable. @ What is MoOLIT? MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time. It will be part of System V Release 4.2. Contact: Joanne Newbauer, jo@usl.com, (908) 522-6677 @ What about that Display PostScript thing? Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X in the next release of OpenWindows. DPS is essentially a badly designed hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously being harder to use, as I understand it. The only real advantage it has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller, being generally less complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine. Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work; what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen. Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems, the DPS extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to ordinary X11 programs. It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard. (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts available, however) Subject: Window Managers -- olwm, olvwm @ What are olwm and olvwm? They are window managers. A window manager is the part of the X Window system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows on the screen, and for managing the user's interaction with the windows. Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager. It's included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations, and you can also get the source by ftp, since Sun donated it. Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the `v' in its name). It shows a little map on the screen, with the currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle. You can move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys. This lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around from one to the other. Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it. Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib directory; there are three patches). @ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm? Yes. If you use twm, for example, or mwm, you won't be able to use the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm, and you (probably) won't see the footers some windows use to display certain messages. If you use twm, you'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus and get rid of programs that don't have a `quit' button when not run under olwm. For twm, put this in your $HOME/.twmrc: LeftTitleButton "target" = f.delete where "target" is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps. Alternatively, try # Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm LeftTitleButton ":menu" = f.menu "OL.menu" menu "OL.menu" { "Quit" f.delete } For mwm, you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told). See the manual page for your window manager (twm, etc). Subject: OpenWindows, Terminals, and Other Displays @ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal? The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView, NeWS (PostScript) and X11. This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems. Unfortunately, it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS or SunView support, and thus won't run on an X terminal. This includes pageview in particular. You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open- Windows display, and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones) will work perfectly well. You may find that you get complaints about fonts not being found. If so, see the Fonts section below. If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal, you may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal's XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help. Subject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows @ What configuration files do I need to know about? .xinitrc and .xsessionrc The first time you run OpenWindows, a .xinitrc file will be created in your login directory ($HOME). If it already exists, you might have to edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and any other old X11 files you have to another directory, and then merge the old and new files. If your site uses xdm, you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc, since xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file. .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory, depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use. Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files without the leading . and copy any you want to change. You may need to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized. If you are not on an X terminal, you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C, shelltool -C, xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano's "contool" program so that system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen. Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc. .Xdefaults You can put X Windows resource specifications in here. In particular, it is a good idea to include at least: OpenWindows.FocusLenience: true *Input: TRUE These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they forget to ask for it. Props, the program that runs when you select `properties' from the default root menu under olwm or olvwm, writes your choices into .Xdefaults. Don't put comments in .Xdefaults, since `props' deletes them. .startup.ps This is the NeWS user profile file, read by OpenWindows (actually xnews) on startup. This is documented in the NeWS programming manual, near the back. The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change the keyboard repeat rate, although you must be very careful, since a syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up at all or will get broken in strange ways. The NeWS manual gives code that is both incorrect and insufficient. WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3. Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see the man page for xset ("man xset", and "xset -help") for more information. Here's what $HOME/.startup.ps should look like if you want a delay of about a third of a second (300000 microseconds), and a repeat rate of twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for OpenWindows 3. You'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime is the delay between keys sent, and thus doesn't include the time to process each key, which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection :-) Again, this is for OpenWindows 3... % don't want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual % /IncludeDemos? false def UserProfile begin /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def % Note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatly... end You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory, like this: /NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage /TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage /TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage ClassRepeatKeys pop % force repeat.ps to autoload endpackage endpackage endpackage If you change these parameters, you can test them without restarting the OpenWindows server like this: $ psh -i .startup.ps Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 $ psh -i Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 /classinit ClassRepeatKeys send %%% now press control-D You can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make the root window be "retained", so that a PostScript drawing on the background won't be erased when you move windows: frambuffer /Retained true put will do this. Note that this may increase the amount of memory used by the NeWS server (xnews) dramatically. See also: Trouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me Type Trouble Shooting: Is there an easy way to edit Xdefaults? Environment Variables @ How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a left-handed mouse and keyboard? You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons, but be prepared for one or two occasional surprises. See also "man 7 xview" for a list of keybindings you can change, at least for XView programs. With OpenWindows 2.0, you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings and then let SunView handle them. The status returned by svenv should tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not; put this in your .xinitrc: if eval `svenv -env` then xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3" input_from_defaults else xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1" fi @ How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle? Run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it's a boring but effective screen saver. See `man screenblank'. Under Solaris 2 you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system, as it's not supplied. Then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system run screenblank automatically. Subject: Key Bindings, Cut and Paste @ How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs? To go from XTerm to textedit (say): * Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button in xterm * Press COPY in the XTerm (this key is L6, or Meta+c (the O'Reilly XView manual gets this wrong) * Move to the textedit window, and press PASTE (L8 or Meta+v) If this doesn't work, see Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste To go the other way, from textedit to XTerm: * Select the text in textedit. No need to use COPY * Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST (the middle mouse button). * You can also use the COPY/CUT and PASTE buttons. @ COPY/PASTE is boring. What short-cuts are available? Quick Copy within textedit, mailtool, etc: * Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go * Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE (or CUT) button * Select the text you want to copy/move. You'll see that it's underlined or crossed out, as appropriate. (In the jed demo it goes grey) * Let go of the PASTE (or CUT) button. * The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret. Drag and Drop to Move a Selection * Select the text you want to copy or move, by dragging or multiple- clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button * Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection * Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button, and move the mouse pointer a little to the right; you'll see the cursor changes to be the first 3 letters of the text (or some other icon). * Still holding SELECT down, move the mouse over the point where you want to drop the text * You may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target, to show that it's OK to drop things here * Let go of SELECT, and the text is moved. This works in text fields of dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows. Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection * This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection, except that you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button. @ What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere? See the man page for textedit(1) for some of them. In general, the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when shifted - e.g. Ctrl+w deletes a word, and Ctrl+W deletes the word to the right of the insert point. Meta-i - include file Meta-f - find selection (forward/backward) Ctrl-a - start of line Ctrl-< - back word Ctrl-e - end of line Ctrl-> - forward word Ctrl-w - delete word Ctrl-u - delete to start/END of line Ctrl-Return - move to end/START of document See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default keys; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page. @ What can I put in my .ttysrc? Where is it documented? See the manual page for shelltool. Subject: Applications: Finding Out... Contact SunSoft (or Sun) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide, which lists over 200 pages of applications, and also the _huge_ Catalyst listing of products for Suns, updated six-monthly. Sun's free CDWare CD/ROMs each contain demo versions of several popular OPEN LOOK applications. Often you can simply contact the vendor concerned to have the license upgraded from demo, and receive the full product documentation. SunPICS produces a CD/ROM for NeWSPrint users, Printer's Pallate, which contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters, as well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license. There is a separate FAQ posting in comp.windows.open-look that lists a number of free and commercial aplications; mail lee@sq.com for a copy, including OPEN LOOK UI Application List in the Subject for a faster reply. Subject: DeskSet, Mailtool, Calendar Manager, etc. @ Is there a tty-based interface to cm (Calendar Manager)? Yes, cm_delete, cm_insert and cm_lookup; these all have manual pages. If "man cm_delete" doesn't work or gives strange messages, see under Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages, below. @ How can I arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail? The best way is: $ cd $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc . $ chmod +w .textswrc edit .textswrc (use vi, textedit, or whatever you prefer) add the follwing: KEY_RIGHT(3) FILTER cat ~/.signature (you might need to change ~ to $HOME) Now pressing R3 will insert your .signature file. Subject: Fonts @ Does OpenWindows support Type 1 PostScript fonts? Yes, under either Solaris 2.0 or 2.1 (I'm not sure which). Or, Not Yet, in other words. If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them, I'm told. The 57 fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted, though, and comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is interesting... The F3 font format is described in a publication from the Sun OpenFonts group, listed in the Bibliography below. Documentation on the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts. You can buy F3 fonts from SunPICS, Monotype, Linotype, URW and probably other major foundries. SunPICS' NeWSPrint software supports Type 1 fonts. @ Improving font rendering time Although the Sun type renderer (TypeScaler) is pretty fast, it's not as fast as loading a bitmap :-). You can pre-generate bitmap fonts for sizes that you use a lot, and you can also alter and access the font cache parameters. If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the font cache size. $ psh -i Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 <--- psh will say this at you currentfontmem = % type this line ... 300 % and here's whai my server was using -- 300 Kbytes 1024 setfontmem % Just to check: currentfontmem = 1024 See pp. 328ff of the NeWS 3.0 Programmer's Guide. You need to say psh -i so that the PostScript packages are loaded - see the psh man page. @ Making bitmap fonts for faster startup: $ mkdir $HOME/myfonts $ cd $HOME/myfonts $ makeafb -20 -M $OPENWINHOME/lib/fonts/Bembo.f3b Creating Bembo20.afb $ convertfont -b Bembo20.afb Bembo20.afb->./Bembo20.fb Chars parameter greater than number of characters supplied. $ ls Bembo20.afb Bembo20.fb Synonyms.list $ bldfamily * Bembo ./Bembo.ff (Encoding: latin) cat: ./Compat.list: No such file or directory $ xset +fp `pwd` $ xset fp rehash If you want the server to see your new font directory every time, add this directory to your FONTPATH environment variable in one of your start-up files, e.g. .login or .profile. @ Converting between font formats (convertfont, etc.) You can also use Folio fonts with an X11 server, by converting them to a bitmap (X11 bdf format) first. Your licence forbids you from using the fonts on another machine, and unless you have NeWSPrint you shouldn't use them for printing. Having said all that... you can use makeafb and convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or bdftopcf. Use mftobdf (from the SeeTeX distribution) to convert TeX pk fonts to X11 bdf format, which you can then use with either X11 or OenWindows. You can also use der Mouse's "getbdf" to get bdf fonts from a running X display server -- ftp: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) /X/getbdf @ Xview/OLIT fonts at 100 dpi There aren't any. More precisely, the various text fonts, such as Lucida Typewriter Sans, are available at 100 dpi, and in fact are scalable under OpenWindows. The glyph fonts are bitmaps, and don't scale very well. Subject: Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages @ No manual entry for cm_lookup If man doesn't seem to find OpenWindows commands, even though you are running OpenWindows, try setting the MANPATH environment variable: MANPATH=$OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man; export MANPATH or setenv MANPATH $OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man for csh users. $OPENWINHOME should be /usr/openwin on most systems. @ window: Window creation failed to get new fd @ window: Base frame not passed parent window in environment @ Cannot create base frame. Process aborted. These messages all come from SunView programs. SunView was an earlier windowing system for Suns, and was not networked. Some of the SunView programs are still around in /usr/bin, and have names that are the same as their OpenWindows counterparts. You almost certainly want to run the programs in $OPENWINHOME instead. Set your path so that $OPENWINHOME/bin (and $OPENWIN/bin/xview for OpenWindows 2) come before /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same), or you'll get the SunView versions of mailtool, cmdtool, shelltool, etc. @ memory fault - core dumped If you get this from the binder, or if binder vanishes suddenly, get the following patches: 100493-02 Binder 100524-03 Cetables 100626-03 Tooltalk @ Trouble compiling Xt, Xmu or OLIT programs: _get_wmShellWidgetClass If you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), contact your local Sun office and request the following patches: 100512-02 4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch 100573-03 4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using shared libXmu If you can't install the patch, a workaround is to add -u get_wmShellWidgetClass -u get_applicationShellWidgetClass on the link (ld or cc ... -o ...) line. An alternative is to add -assert nodefinitions to CFLAGS in your Makefile, or even in Imake.tmpl. Subject: Trouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me Type @ When I try to type into some programs, I just get beeps or nothing happens It is a good idea to include at least: OpenWindows.FocusLenience: true *Input: TRUE in your .Xdefaults file, as these allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they forget to ask for it. See the next item for editing .Xdefaults Subject: Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste not working @ I can't paste from xterm to XView (including Sun DeskSet) programs Under OpenWindows 2, you need to add the following either to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file, or to $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm instead: XTerm*VT100.Translations: #override \ <Key>L6:select-set(CLIPBOARD)\n\ <Key>L8:insert-selection(CLIPBOARD) You must not move the mouse between ending the selection and pressing L8 (the Paste key)! Under OpenWindows 3, this is already in the app-defaults file, so if it isn't working, check that XFILESEARCHPATH is set to /usr/openwin/lib/%T/%N%S and if it isn't, either set it or copy/merge the above lines from $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm into /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm. [See also: Environment Variables] This version automatically puts each xterm selection onto the clipboard: XTerm*VT100.translations: #override\n\ ~Ctrl ~Meta<Btn2Up>: insert-selection(PRIMARY,CUT_BUFFER0)\n\ ~Ctrl ~Meta<BtnUp>: select-end(PRIMARY,CUT_BUFFER0,CLIPBOARD)\n\ <KeyPress>L8: insert-selection(CLIPBOARD) [Note: be sure that the \n\ is at the very end of the line, there must be no following spaces, and any + or | signs showing that this FAQ file was altered must also be removed!] If you are using X11R5, you may find that adding the lines <Key>L10: start-extend() select-end(PRIMARY, CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER0)\n\ <KeyRelease>L10: kill-selection() \n before the <KeyPress>L8 line will make L10 (CUT) work as a cut key! If you alter $HOME/.Xdefaults instead, you must use what X calls a `more specific' resource name: xterm.vt100.translations will do. @ I can't paste from XView (including Sun DeskSet) programs to xterm If you don't have the Sun L keys on the left of your keyboard, you can use Meta-x, Meta-c and Meta-v for cut, coy and paste respectively. You can change the keys by adding the following two lines to your .Xdefaults file, edited as you wish (the values shown here are the defaults): Openwindows.KeyboardCommand.Copy: c+Meta,L6 OpenWindows.KeyboardCommand.Paste", "v+Meta,L8 Lists of resources are in the manual page for xview, and also in the thinnish blue book `Companion to Volume 7, XView Reference Manual' from O'Reilly, and also in the olwm and olvwm manual pages. @ I always get the same piece of text when I press PASTE (L8, Meta+v) Remove the file /tmp/textsw_shelf and see if that helps; see also the next item. @ Cut Copy and Paste don't work at all (OpenWindows only) Oh dear. Use ps -xuaww | grep xv to check that sv_xv_sel_svc is running and that either you or root started it, depending on whether you started OpenWindows with "openwin" or by logging in through xdm. If not, start it. If it dies, check that there is no /tmp/.sv_xv_sel_svc before restarting it - you may need to be root to remove it, or you can reboot your workstation. Check that there is space in /tmp (use "df /tmp"), and also see if there are a lot of files there with names like /tmp/tty.txt.a01246; if there are several hundred of them, cut and paste may take so long that it times out. Quit any deskset tools such as mailtool, filemgr and cm (calendar), start a terminal emulator and remove and /tmp/tty.txt* and /tmp/Text* files that are still there. It's simplest to quit openwin and start it again after doing that, if cut and paste was broken, but if it starts working again you can just carry on. Note that files in /tmp not owned by you might be in use by another worker comrade, so don't remove those without checking first! Subject: Trouble Shooting: Not authorized to use display If you get error messages that look like Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server Xlib: Internal error during connection authorization check Error: Can't Open display try, on the machine running OpenWindows or X11, xhost +machine where "machine" is the computer on which you ran the command that failed. If you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you, using your display, you will have to type the bizarre-looking xhost +`hostname` (or xhost +happyboy, if happyboy is the name of your workstation). This lets ANY user on `happyboy' access your display. With OpenWindows 3.0 you can also use xauth, and the Programmer's Guide describes how to do this in Chapter 8, p. 101. This is more secure. Also check the man page for fbtab(5) to stop other users accessing the framebuffer directly! Also note that there is a Sun patch for OpenWindows 3.0 under SunOS 4.1.1 to fix a serious security problem. It is available through your local Sun Answer Center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net [192.48.96.2] system in /sun-dist: Fix PatchID Filename Checksum loadmodule 1076118 100448-01.tar.Z 04354 5 On an X Terminal, there may be a setup menu that lets you change or disable the list of hosts that can access the display. If you start getting this message after you've been logged in overnight, there might be a cron job that's removing the Unix sockets in /tmp that are used to communicate with the server when $DISPLAY doesn't have a hostname before the :, or is empty. Have the system administrator change the cron script to skip sockets. Subject: Trouble Shooting: other common problems @ I get console error messages on my screen and they don't go away (Sun 3 or 4) If "refresh" makes the messages vanish, but new ones come along later, you need to run "xterm -C" from your .xinitrc, or start one up in the background and then choose Save Workspace from the Workspace->Utilities menu. Better still, pick up "contool" and run that. Get it from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib directory. It will monitor the console and open, flash its icon or beep when a message appears; it's very easy to configure. If "refresh" from the Workspace->Utilities menu doesn't make the messages, go away... a Sun with a cg4 frame buffer has two screens - you can move the mouse off the right-hand (by default) edge of the screen and onto a whole new (but monochrome) display, called ":0.1". See the man. page for openwin; I have a shell script that checks for this and, if there's a /dev/cgfour0, does openwin -dev /dev/cgfour0 -dev /dev/bwtwo0 If you are running X11 or OpenWindows 2, you might need to add this to your .xinitrc or other startup file: ( eval `svenv -display unix:0.1 -env` olvwm -display unix:0.1 ) & Later releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically. You can also run switcher -e 0 to get rid of the messages. Also, see the note about contool, above. @ Is there an easy way of editing .Xdefaults? Use `props', which appears in the default root menu as `properties'. This starts `props', a property editor which will re-write your .Xdefaults after removing comments. It then applies any changes. Keep comments by using "comment." instead of "!", for example, comment.*.font: Palatino-Italic-37 @ How do I get the File manager to use emacs instead of textedit? set the default editor to sh -c "exec emacs -font lucidasanstypewriter-18 \"$FILE\"" (you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one) @ How do I run OpenWindows in inverse video? This tends not to work under OpenWindows 2. With OpwnWindows 3.0, there are various ways, including using -bg and -fg options. If you're using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3 , probably the best you can do (short of upgrading the workstation to a SPARC!) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool. @ Why don't flat check-boxes work? A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use these. A workaround is to edit the Guide output, as it's only Guide's output that's broken, not the actual check-box code. This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0. If you're still using an ancient DevGuide, you should upgrade as soon as possible; the new one is fantastic! @ When I leave OpenWindows, my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays on the screen. Try running clear_colormap; if this helps, put it as the last line in the shell script you use to start OpenWindows (e.g. `openwin'). @ When I use snapshot, the system crashes, or the server hangs, or something. This was a bug related to some systems only. The only work-round was to use some other screen dump program, such as xwd, xv 2.21 or xgrabsc. @ Why have some of my function keys stopped working? Keys F11 and F12 changed from SunF36 and SunF37 to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37 respectively in OpenWindows 3. Applications must be recompiled, or you might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to change your keyboard layout back again. @ When I type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit, I get the Sunview version See under "Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages" below. (see also next item) @ Mixing X11 and OpenWindows (see also next item) Note that OpenWindows 3.0 includes the X11R4 core distribution (to patch level 18), but not the contrib directory. These notes apply to OpenWindows 2.0, although you could also the do same sort of thing with OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5. Install the X11 libraries in /usr/lib/X11. You can intermix OpenWindows and X11R4 or X11R5, they're all compatible in this respect. Put the X11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/X11. Put /usr/bin/X11 last in your PATH, so that you get OpenWindows versions of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate, although this is a matter of preference. In any event, put the OpenWindows bin directory first -- see the preceding item for more details on that. If you have /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same directory on SunOS) earlier in your PATH than $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview, you'll get SunView programs instead of OpenWindows ones! Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/openwin/lib is last, after the X11 library directory. This doesn't matter with OpenWindows 3.0, but with older versions you'll get error messages from X11 programs if you don't do this. The messages are generally harmless (see next item), although xdm core dumps if this isn't right. Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't /usr/openwin. See Also: Environment Variables (especially XFILESEARCHPATH). @ I get error messages on my screen about ld.so: libX11.so.4 not found set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be /usr/openwin. If you also use X11, use /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib If you put this in a shell script or your .profile, use ${OPENWINHOME-/usr/openwin}/lib instead of /usr/openwin; this is for /bin/sh; for csh it is different. @ I launch my filemgr and I get ld.so:map heap error (9) at /dev/zero Your system needs to be patched. Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib/OSpatches and install the patch. @ Why doesn't AnswerBook run for me? You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook. It won't run under X11 (on an X terminal or on anything else) because it uses NeWS to draw the PostScript text and pictures. If you are using OpenWindows 3.0, you need to use the OpenWindows 3.0 compatible navigator; it's called .navigator.ow3 on the AnswerBook CD/ROM. If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows 3.0, you can replace navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether (rename the old one first to satisfy your sense of paranoia!) The navigator.ow3 binary is also on CD/Ware Vol 2. Note that the data files are in PostScript, so you can look at them with a PostSript viewer (q.v.). @ Why aren't there any fish in realxfishdb? A fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from ftp.eng.auburn.edu [131.204.10.91] as /pub/realxfishdb.Z @ Why is the Properties choice disabled in the Window menu? It isn't implemented yet. Many programs do respond to the Properties Key (L3), though, or have a pop-up menu with Properties on it. @ File completion in the C-shell is broken in cmdtool Sadly true, but use shelltool or xterm instead and it's fine. It also works if you run command tool on a remote machine. Fixed in OpenWindows 3.0.1 shipped with Solaris 2. @ When I run OLIT programs, some of the widgets are red! Release 3 of OLIT added mouseless operation; action widgets can be selected via the keyboard. The currently selected item is highlighted in red (the `Red Stain') to show that it has the input focus. To disable it in most places, add this to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file: *traversalOn: off *TextEdit.traversalOn: on *TextField.traversalOn: on You can change the color using (for example) *InputFocusColor: grey50 *input*FocusColor: green *List*inputFocusColor: <your background color> See the man page resources(3w), at the start of the OLIT 3 Widget Set Reference Manual included in the OpenWindows 3 programmer documentation. Meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id 100451-30, the OLIT/3.0 CTE Jumbo Patch. @ When I run several programs, the colors on the screen all change when I move into a different window! ("colormap flashing") This is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time. However, you can minimise the effect with the following procedure: * Start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve. * Run cmap_compact save to create the .owcolors file * Put the line cmap_compact init near the start of your start-up file (.xinitrc) * Exit and then restart the window system. * cmap_compact init will push those colors .owcolors to the end of the colormap and reserves them. Also note that control-L2 locks the colors of the current window, and Control-L4 unlocks them -- this is described in the olwm manual page. @ pageiew uses the wrong colors, or makes the colormap flash (see above): This problem was reported by people for some reason running the Motif window manager (mwm) with OpenWindows. Try running pageview like this: $OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -svmono $OPENWINHOME/bin/pageview $OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -discard @ XDM breaks things Command tool doesn't like being run without a Unix `controlling terminal'. Use /etc/setsid to start your command tools and all will be well. SunView applications may need to be run with svenv, as in svenv -exec /usr/bin/traffic because xdm won't set the necessary environment variables. Note that the MIT xdm starts up the X server as root, which is a security hole for OpenWindows; use the OpenWindows 3.0 xdm or be aware that your users can access files and start Unix processes ass root... @ Function keys 11 and 12 stopped working In OpenWindows 3.0, the X11 names ("keysyms") for these keys was changed to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37. Code which uses them should be recompiled, or you might be able to get away with xmodmap -e 'keysym SunXK_F36 = SunF36' Subject: Trouble Shooting: XView problems This section is here only until an XView FAQ appears, which has been promised, but hasn't reached here. Note that there is also a usenet newsgroup, alt.toolkits.xview, although it doesn't sem to have very wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles per month. You should also look at the FAQ in comp.windows.x. @ how do I set the font of individual Scrolling List items? PANEL_LIST_FONT takes an int row_number and an Xv_opaque font_handle. PANEL_LIST_FONTS take a NULL terminated list of Xv_opaque font_handles. There is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font. You have to make sure that you always specify PANEL_LIST_FONT when you insert a new row into that list, or write a convenience function insert_row(list, row, string) that hides the nasty bits. @ how do I keep an XView pop-up window displayed after a button is pressed? In the button callback, do xv_set(button, PANEL_NOTIFY_STATUS, XV_ERROR, NULL); This will keep the window visible. You might also need to investigate the MENU_NOTIFY_STATUS attribute. @ how do I make an XView button look pressed? call panel_begin_preview() and panel_cancel_preview(); these are documented in -- er -- the XView 3 source... @ OpenWindows 3 imake doesn't work properly Here is Greg Earle's patch, to be applied in $OPENWINHOME; note that you should edit lib/config/sun.cf afterwards to get OSName and OSMinorVersion right (MinorVersion is 1 in SunOS 4.1.2, for example).

This list is for OpenWindows 3.0 -- differences for OpenWindows 2.0 are marked, and I've added some comments for users of X11R4 and X11R5, too. DISPLAY The name of the X Windows Display to use :0.0 (on the local machine, the one actually running X11 or xnews) :0.1 (on some machines for a second, monochrome screen) machine-running-unix:0.0 (on other machines) (You may need to do "xhost +other-machine" to let programs on other machines use your display; see also under Trouble Shooting, and see the section on xauth in the OpenWindows Version 3 Programmer's Guide, pp. 101ff) See also: console messages, under Trouble Shooting FONTPATH Where xnews searches for fonts /usr/openwin/lib/fonts (you can also use "xset fp+ dir" to add a directory to the font path, but you may have to do "xset fp rehash" afterwards. This is fine under OpenWindows, but many X11 servers have font problems) HELPPATH Where XView looks when you press the Help key (or F1) /usr/openwin/lib/locale:/usr/openwin/lib/help (On SunOS 4.0.*, or with OpenWindows 2.0, omit the first entry, which is for sites using a local other than "C" or "USA"). LD_LIBRARY_PATH Where to look to find shared C libraries /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib:/usr/CC/`arch` (the /usr/CC/`arch`/lib entry is only needed if you use C++ programs) OPENWINHOME Where OpenWindows lives /usr/openwin KEYBOARD, MOUSE -- serial devices to use instead of the console (don't set these for normal use; /dev/kbd and /dev/mouse) PATH Where the Shell searches for programs to run $(OPENWINHOME)/bin:$(OPENWINHOME)/bin/xview:/usr/local/bin:.\ $HOME/bin.`arch`:/usr/ucb:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/hosts:\ (you will certainly want to change this example! There is no $(OPENWINHOME)/bin/xview in OpenWindows 3.0) XFILESEARCHPATH Where programs look for app-defaults files /usr/openwin/lib/%T/%N%S (This is set automatically by "openwin" in OpenWindows 3.0) You might want to use /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S, or perhaps both, separated with a :, for example (for sh users) XFILESEARCHPATH=$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N%S:/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S export XFILESEARCHPATH If you use X11R5, you might instead want /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C%S: /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C%S: /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C%S: /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%S: /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%S: /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S: $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N%S (put all this on one line, though, with no spaces!) Together with the following in lib/Xinitrc xrdb -merge <<'END_XRDB' *customization: END_XRDB xrdb -merge <<'END_XRDB' #ifdef COLOR *customization: -color #endif END_XRDB you automatically get a color oclock, editres, bitmap, xcalc, and xlogo since they use the "*customization" resource appearing as %C in the XFILESEARCHPATH. (see oclock (n)) according to Rainer Sinkwitz <sinkwitz@ifi.unizh.ch>. Subject: Where Can I get It? Ftp, implementations, etc... XView 3.0 is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu and elsewhere. MoOLIT can be bought from AT&T in source form. OpenWindows can be obtained from Sun, or you can get the source from Interactive Systems Inc. It is also included in some vendors' System V Release 4 implementations, although that's not always the latest version. The current release of OpenWindows from Sun for supported architectures is 3.0; for the Sun 3 series it is frozen at OpenWindows 2.0. Note that Sun includes OpenWindows with SunOS, and it is also included as the windowing system for Solaris. There are said (by Sun) to be over 35 ports of OpenWindows either available now or in progress. Unfortunately, none of them seem to be available from anywhere. Contact anthony@ovi.com for more information. Subject: Bibliography: books, manuals, journals, papers, beer-mats The OPEN LOOK (tm) Graphical Interface is documented in two books: Sun Microsystems Inc., `OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface Application Style Guidelines', Addison Wesley, 1989 and Sun Microsystems Inc., `OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface Functional Specification', Addison Wesley The Main documentation for the X Window system comes from O'Reilly & Associates in about nine or ten volumes. The most useful for OPEN LOOK users are: Volume 1: XLib Programming Manual Volume 2: XLib Reference Manual Volume 3: X Window System User's Guide (An OPEN LOOK edition of Volume 3 should appear later this year) Volume 7: XView Programmer's Manual [Dan Heller] [make sure you get the 3rd edition for XView 3.0] Companion to Volume 7: XView Reference Manual [Ed. Thomas Van Raalte] The Companion to Volume 7 is an expanded version of the Attribute Summary from the previous edition of the XView Programming Manual, together with other reference information, so that in practice you have to buy both books. O'Reilly also have a thinnish orange book on the differences between X11R4 and RX115. OLIT programmers will also want the Xt books - volumes 4 and 5. There is a new big fat green Vol 5 updated for X11R5. A journal, The X Resource, may also be of interest.

The System V Release 4 Documentation from Prentice Hall may also include a section on OpenWindows. David Miller describes programming with OLIT in his `An OPEN LOOK At Unix' (M&T press). Nabajyoti Brkakati gives an excellent introduction to X and to OLIT programming, as well as setting up and using X and OpenWindows, in: `Unix[R] Desktop Guide to OPEN LOOK' SAMS, 1992 ISBN 0-672-30023-0 You can get the examples from this book as export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/naba-olguide-examples.tar.Z Also about using OLIT, and Xt in particular: The X Window System: Programming and Applications with Xt, OPEN LOOK Edition, Doug Young and John Pew, Prentice Hall, 1992, ISBN 0-13-982992-X There are also HP Widgets and Motif (ugh) versions of this book. The example source code in this book can be obtained by ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu, file "contrib/young.pew.olit.Z". There is an introduction to XView in `Writing Applications For Sun Systems', Vol 1, `A Guide for Macintosh(R) Programmers' (Sun Microsystems, pub. Addison Wesley) To learn more about the NeWS and PostScript languages, see The NeWS Book, Springer Verlag, 1989 (sadly, a little out of date) PostScript Language Reference Manual, Second Edition, Adobe Systems Inc., Addison Wesley, 1990 ["the Red Book"] Note that OpenWindows 3 is a level 1 PostScript implementation, with certain Level 2 features (such as Composite Fonts) to some degree. PostScript Language Tutorial and Cookbook, Adobe Systems Inc., Addison Wesley, 1985 ["The blue book"] There's at least one book on using Solaris (i.e. SunOS). Sun also supplies a large amount of documentation with OpenWindows, although you may have to order it separately. Here's what I have; they are each a little over 21 cm square (wider than A4 paper), and vary from about 1 cm to about 3cm thick. They say `User's Guide' or `Programmer's Guide' on the front.

ToolTalk 1.0 Setup and Administration Guide (SunSoft, 1991) 800-6093-10 ToolTalk 1.0 Programmer's Guide (SunSoft, 1991) There might be documentation about the Link Manager somewhere, too. AT&T includes several large thorny bushes' worth of paper with OLIT. Sun's AnswerBook CD/ROM contains a lot of the above documentation, including some of the O'Reilly books (not the XView 3 Volume 7, though). Volume 8 of the O'Reilly series is about X Administration, and mentions OpenWindows, although it is primarily aimed at X11R5. Several other books are in the works...

Since I'm on the ubiquitous 8-bit pseudo color display I would have thought it could tell that. -- This is news. This is your | Peter Scott, NASA/JPL/Caltech brain on news.

Nntp-Posting-Host: wiwi12.uni-bielefeld.de Organization: Universitaet Bielefeld Keywords: windows, widgets Lines: 23 I have the task to program a X application for the first time and have some severe difficulties creating a window in which I can draw something. Unfortunately some basic books on the topic of X application programming are not available to me for the moment. I am running a hp720 with hpux 8.07, VUE and X11R4 using Xt anbd Xaw. What I did until now: I initialized the X Intrinsics cxreating a top level widget with XtAppInitialize. I passed as a application_class name 'commandWidgetClass'. Then I set the argument values for window height and width using XtSetArg and passed it to the toplevel widget with XtSetValues. When I call XtRealizeWidget, I get a window of the specified size, but I have no idea how I can draw something in it. Can anybody send me some help and perhaps some basic information how to use the widgets ? In which situation it is useful to use them and in which not ?

This means that if you server return a response like the following -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--0-0-75-75-p-0-iso8859-1 You can ask for the follwogin: -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--14-100-90-90-p-0-iso8859-1 and it will generate it for you.

I got a few requests asking for a summary, so I'll attempt one here: Here's the ones I know of: Wind/U - Bristol Technologies Hunter SDK - Hunter Systems MainWin - MainSoft LIBWXM - Visual Solutions Hunter The company is going through some big changes. I expect to eventually see the Hunter SDK pop up with a new name. At the moment, it is difficult to get phone calls returned and otherwise obtain info. Hopefully they will post something about themselves once things settle down. Visual Solutions LIBWXM is a product that I just heard about. They don't yet support MDI or MFC. Libwxm was used to port VisSim, a mathematical modeling package. Does native Motif Widgets, like Wind/U from Bristol. Contact Carrie Lemieux at 508 392 0100 for more info. She's very helpful. MainSoft This translates Windows source to a Unix executable that can switch off between a Windows or Quasi-Motif look and feel at runtime. They skip the Xt and Xm (Motif) X toolkit levels and go straight to Xlib. They don't yet support MFC. They're at 415 896 0708. Bristol This company that seems to be on the right track. Wind/U uses Xlib/Xt/Xm to give a *real* Motif app. They seem to be doing the most work in trying to support things like DDE, Common Dialogs, and more on the horizon. My contact there is knowledgeable, responds to my email, and wrote an example program for me showing how to obtain X widgets from Windows handles.

One usual suggestion is to put everything into your every-time shell rc-file instead of your login-only one, which is fair enough if you only have a few users who know what they're doing. If you have several hundred users who do what the books tell them, though, then it's confusing at best. Another is to have your xterms run login shells, but that still leaves the window manager and the things that get started from its menus with the wrong environment. Our alternative is that instead of having xdm run the client startup scripts, it runs the user's favourite shell as a login shell, and has *it* then run the rest of the startup scripts. That way the user's usual environment gets set up as normal and inherited by everything. You can find an almost-current copy of our scripts and things in contrib/edinburgh-environment.tar.Z, available from the usual places. -- George D M Ross, Department of Computer Science, University of Edinburgh Kings Buildings, Mayfield Road, Edinburgh, Scotland, EH9 3JZ Mail: gdmr@dcs.ed.ac.uk Voice: 031-650 5147 Fax: 031-667 7209	4

What I'd like to see is this scenario: Each widget, view, whatever, describes it's colors via a palette. Palettes can be shared and they only contain descriptive information. They are not directly tied to the object that uses them. Palettes are held in the server. A palette can accomadate, up to, the number of hardware color cells of color descriptors. When the input focus is in a particular widget, that widget has access to all of the colors that are described in its associated palette. ALL OTHER WIDGETS, TRANSIENTLY, GET THE CLOSEST APPROXIMATION THAT CAN BE GENERATED BY A UNION OF THE COLORS FROM THE CURRENT PALETTE AND ANY FREE COLORS THAT ARE LEFT OVER. A widget specifies a color for imaging by providing an index (pixel) into its associated palette. The bold part above is hard and would need to be done in the server.	4

So, use XCreateColormap() with the proper visual and use it in SetWinAttrib (and don't forget the mask!). And the inevitable caveat: I usually use widgets, setting the visual and colormap resources rather than direct X routines, so I could be wrong. But, I think this is the general difficulty.

I for one am going, because I, too, am curious about the technology. I think this is a great chance to learn about NT, mainly because: - It will be presented in X's "home turf". I believe that the attendees will mostly have X backgrounds (biases? :-); thus, I expect that the NT presentations will face a tough audience. - I can be there in person to judge for myself whether or not NT is what it is hyped to be. This is as closely as I can get to in evaluating the NT technology without actually using it myself, which I don't have the time to do. - If NT turns out to be a vapor technology and I get bored, there will be many other interesting tutorials/presentations that I won't have to waste my time ... in California?!? :-) Just my thoughts... -- Ik Su Yoo RRC-4F728, x5764 ik@leis.bellcore.com	4

I've just installed the new XArchie 2.0.1 and it all works fine, except: on our grayscale xterm the custom icons compiled into the program don't work at all, but on the BW terminal it works fine. I can set the icon to an xbm file with .twmrc, but that doesn't give the neat-o change when busy action. (Other programs with similar actions, e.g. xmail, xbiff, work fine.) The X-interface author, George Ferguson, suggests it might be a problem with the X intrinsics, but isn't willing to hack around to fix it himself. But I know zero about X programming, so I don't think I can find it. Does anyone out there know an obvious fix for the problem?

First, at least one of our applications (Maple) doesn't seem to understand how to deliver the magic cookie, and won't run on a display with authorization turned on. Second, we have people with client software on remote machines, and I really don't want to hassle them with having to copy their .Xauthority file to the remote machine... assuming that the clients there support Xauthorization. So, what I would like to do is turn on MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE by default, with non-privileged users able to turn it off - dropping back to host-based authorization. (Yes, I know how to turn it off by changing the Xconfig file for the heads and the Client Authorize setting for the Xterminals, but non-privileged users can't do this.) I've checked with the HP Support Line, and there doesn't appear to be a way. Can anyone confirm this, or do you know of a way to accomplish what I want? BTW, I'm running HPUX 9.0, and Vue 3.0.

Prior to using xdm, I used to set PATH and other environment variables (like MANPATH, HELPPATH, ARCH, etc) in my .login file. With xdm, the .login file doesn't get executed and therefore neither the olwm root-window nor my applications know about these variables. I used the "DisplayManager._0.userPath" resource in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config to succesfully pass the PATH variable. But I am having problems passing anything else!!! I tried execing $HOME/.login in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession but that didn't help. I also tried using "DisplayManager.exportList: HELPPATH MANPATH ARCH" which didn't work either.

A hundred of them on a single ethernet might be >a problem, but a couple dozen should be fine. Bandwidth is unlikely to be the problem, except over a wet string network. One of major flaws of X is the horrendous number of transactions (and hence process switches) that it forces upon a host. Actual measurements (hourly average) are 5 per second per logged in user, which can lead to 20-50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event is filtered by the window manager as well as the applications and how many processes are needed for each character.) While a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking process, and does not add any transactions, it will add something like 10 process switches per second per user. This is a significant increase in overhead, especially as the application may have quite a large working set. If you want a rapidly blinking cursor, there could be as many as 50. If you want to go there, I wouldn't start from here! Nick Maclaren University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, New Museums Site, Pembroke Street, Cambridge CB2 3QG, England.

Lines: 92 Bristol Technology announces the availability of its HyperHelp(tm) and Xprinter(tm) demo for downloading. This demo showcases the two products in the form of a diagram editor called DE. Download the demo and see some of these exciting features for yourself: o Complete on-line context sensitive help system. o Printing support for PCL5 and PostScript. o Rotated Text support! o Source code for the demo is provided. The demo is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9). There are two versions of the demo located in the vendor/Bristol directory: Sun - sun4.demo.tar.Z (SunOS 4.x) HP - hp700.tar.Z (HP-UX 8 & 9) If you have any questions about the demo, send an e-mail to: support@bristol.com. If you want another version of the demo (rs6000,etc...) please send an e-mail to: info@bristol.com. Remember to use binary mode! What are HyperHelp and Xprinter? Read on...... --------------------------------------------------------- Bristol Technology is proud to announce version 3.0 of its popular HyperHelp product and version 2.0 of Xprinter. HyperHelp 3.0 ------------- HyperHelp is the de-facto standard for on-line context sensitive help in the Unix marketplace. Through a one line function call, application developers can access the full features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on their development time. HyperHelp can use the same RTF, project, and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility. This allows a documentation department to maintain a single set of help documents portable between MS Windows, Motif and Open Look. HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker. And with HyperHelp 3.0 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler! New features in HyperHelp 3.0 include secondary windows,a character based viewer, segmented bitmaps, SGML support, and an improved History window. Xprinter 2.0 ------------ Xprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated printer support to their existing/new X based applications very easily. Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both the display and printer. This lets you use the exact same code for drawing and printing. Take a look at the source code for our demo and see Xprinter in action. If you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 support to your application, Xprinter is the tool for you! Earlier this year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement that resulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technology for UNIX SVR4.2. Feel free to run the demo and let us know what you think about HyperHelp and Xprinter. If you have any questions or comments, send them to us at: info@bristol.com or call us at (203) 438-6969. Happy demoing, The staff at Bristol Technology	4

I am adding an event handler for StructureNotify to the TopLevelShell: XtAddEventHandler(topLevel,StructureNotifyMask,False,configureCB,myData); This works fine, and my callback is called whenever the window is resized or repositioned using the window manager (mwm). However, when I'm just resizing the window, using any resize handle on the window manager resize decoration, the x and y are set to zero in the XEvent passed to the event handler callback. I'm accessing the xconfigure structure, like the X11 manual says. (xev->xconfigure.x, xev->xconfigure.y). The width and height memebers are correct. When I reposition the window, using the window manager, the xevent's xconfigure structure contains all the correct x, y, width, height member settings. Q1: Anybody know why, when just resizing, the x and y are being set to zero? Q2: Any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes? I've tried using XtGetValues() on the topLevel widget when exiting my application (before destroying any widgets) and all I get is garbage values for the x, y, width, height resources.

The > default is to do overstriking of the normal font. I have tried that with one font, if your xterm terminfos/termcaps are set up to NOT remap bold (which they are be default) to reverse, then nothing happens when bold is displayed. It would appear (at least in X11R4) than you cannot display bold in an xterm without specifying two fonts; a normal and a bold. I wish someone would prove that incorrect. -- /--------------------------------------------------------------------------\ | Mark A.

From: visser@eedwsa.itwol.bhp.com.au (Martin Visser) Distribution: world Nntp-Posting-Host: eedwsa.itwol.bhp.com.au Lines: 27 I've found a problem in the use of Xlib functions regarding re-entrancy. I decided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling XDefineCursor from a SIG_ALRM signal handler. This is used to indicate we are waiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system). I was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring the standard cursor when complete. I found dumped core , and upon analysis it was when the SIG_ALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call. XDrawString was doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the XDefineCursor was called. Presumably the (internal) structure that XDrawString was manipulating was not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldn't have been. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there any official documentation that says you should ensure this doesn't happen? Or should bcopy() be atomic. We are running on SGI Irix 4.0.1 with X11R4. -- Regards, Martin /\/\ : Martin Visser - Electrical / Software Engineer / / /\ : Engineering Technology Department / / / \ : BHP Steel - Slab and Plate Products Division / / / /\ \ : P.O.

In X10, the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing requests; that is, the server's drawing model was stateless. This caused problems with performance and network traffic, so the X11 redesign included the graphic context to codify the drawing state. Most application designers who want to draw things in several different colors create a GC for each color during initialization, then pass the GC id in each drawing request.

The significant change this time, and the justification for the hike in the major version number, is: o undo has been implemented. By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited, levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is supported. There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-) -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of what it is all about: aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant improvement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it features, amongst other things, o multiple windows o multiple buffers o default menu interface o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons under user control o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters o provision for defining a keyboard macro o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters o file selection via a browser o knowledge of line numbers o parenthesis matching o regular expression searching o restricted or unlimited undo o ability to change font o easy entry of control codes o xterm-like keymap feature o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources) o both brief and comprehensive on-line help o server mode with cooperating client programs o optional extension language using Tcl o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe I have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and Xaw3d options, on the following systems: Sun SPARC SunOS 4.1.x MIT X11R5 Sun SPARC SunOS 5.1 MIT X11R5 Encore Multimax UMAX 4.3 MIT X11R5 DEC 5000/120 ULTRIX 4.2 MIT X11R5 HP 9000/710 HP-UX 8.07 MIT X11R5 MAC IIci AU/X 3.0 MIT X11R5 but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have only tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first. A number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is provided for those systems that do not have one. Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been encountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under R4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known problems. Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If it doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release, 2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as many features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only that, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of aXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2 never got converted to make use of it. aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due course from several other ftp sites. Check your nearest using xarchie. If you can't ftp, try sending email to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with the word "help" alone in your message body. You will receive instructions on how to ftp via email.

I have a display that is a non-interlaced, memory mapped, 1-bit 720x280 display. The server's view of the world, (obtained via xwd | xwud), seems to be exactly what it should be. However, the displayed version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is using scanlines that are too long. After a bit of experimentation, it seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to a word boundry, but the scanline size in the buffer is 90 bytes, which isn't exactly divisible by four. Changing the following defines in mit/server/include/servermd.h: ---- #define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD 32 #define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD 5 #define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD 2 --- to: --- #define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD 16 #define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD 4 #define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD 2 --- Was not exactly the right solution. How do I tell the server either (a) don't pad the scan lines at all ('cause this server is only being built to run on this particular display), or to pad only to byte boundries? I'm using a customized version of XFree86v1.2, under Mach 3.0. Thanks Brian	4

You have to run up the window heirarchy (using XQueryTree()) until you get to the root window. Now, this is not so simple because some window managers slap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window, so be sure to take that into account for further calculations. Calculate the position and width/height offsets for each window using XGetGeometry(). BE SURE TO TAKE THE BORDER_WIDTH INTO CONSIDERATION. Remember a windows border_width IS ON THE OUTSIDE of a window, so the windows x,y,width,height must be adjusted accordingly. All of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the window-manager is using. Now, to place the new window, you have to use the same numbers to calculate where you want to place it, because the window-manager will re-parent it on the OUTSIDE of where you place your window (if I remember correctly). DISCLAIMER: All of this is from memory, and I no longer have the code. But I did get it working under several window managers correctly.

Similarly, there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum for SCO products in general. With the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional SCO newsgroups, many current contributors including those who have been active in circulating SCO related newsgroups and mailing lists felt that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco.* hierarchy to improve propagation (and hence availability) worldwide. biz.sco.{opendesktop,general,announce} were newgrouped May 1, 1991 in accordance with accepted procedure within "biz". Given the content, this change relocated the "opendesktop" newsgroup to a more proper place within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new "announce" and "general" groups. On Aug 1, 1991, the former "sco-list@uunet.uu.net" became "scogen" in keeping with established biz.sco.* naming conventions. biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on June 1, 1992 to respectively accommodate SCO Xenix, UNIX and OpenDesktop specific binaries and source code. The binaries and sources news groups are moderated, with moderator and submissions information and policy outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups. Respecting USENET etiquite, these newsgroups are _not_ gated to mailing lists, but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts. biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped Dec 14, 1992, to provide a discussion area for the readers, writers and publishers of SCO Magazine. Subject to the USENET NEWS hierarchies carried by your upstream feed, you are now able to subscribe to the following: Newsgroup mailing list subscription --------- ------------------------- biz.sco.opendesktop scoodt-request@xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.general scogen-request@xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.announce scoann-request@xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.sources <none> biz.sco.binaries <none> biz.sco.magazine scomag-request@xenitec.on.ca You are _strongly_ encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via USENET NEWS mechanisms vrs mail. Anyone having difficulty arranging a news feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and I'll do my best to help. We also offer all required software in source code form via anonymous FTP and UUCP, as do many archive sites. If, after having explored all options, you are still unable to receive biz.sco.* as news, you may subscribe to the mailing lists. The 4 discussion newsgroups are bi-directionally gated to companion mailing lists, so anyone not having access to NEWS but who does have a UUCP or Internet mail feed can still participate fully using email. Mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate "mailing list subscription" address above, including in the message body: Add: subscriber_address -eg- Add: your_logname@site.do.main -or- Add: up!stream!yoursite!your_logname Inclusion of an alternative working bang-path relative to a well know major functional site might prove beneficial. Deletions are handled the same way, simply substitute "Delete:" for "Add:", ensuring that you use the exact same address you subscribed with. Mailing list subscribers receive "how to post to the mlist" article submission information when their request is processed. If you don't receive an acknowledgement within a few days, check your routing and try a test message via xenitec.on.ca back to your host. In such cases, it's likely that someone, somewhere, is bouncing mail replies to you (and would do the same with mailing list traffic), and you'll want to resolve your connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again. Mailing list subscriptions are free, subject to whatever arrangements you may have with the site(s) feeding you. Should you receive no response or experience a sudden and prolonged drop to zero volume on one of the mailing lists, this indicates that we are no longer able to find a working route to your site. We loose a handful of subscribers this way each month. If this happens to you, please email us your known working bang-path relative to a major site. What's in the newsgroups (and mailing_lists where applicable): biz.sco.opendesktop: Technical questions and answers and informative postings relating to past, present, and future implementations of the SCO OpenDeskTop operating environment and it's various bundled components. biz.sco.general: Questions, answers and comments on SCO products in general, and of course resulting discussions. biz.sco.announce: SCO and SCO Developer product announcements of interest to current and future users of SCO products, and to SCO developers, resellers and distributors. (moderated, followups directed to biz.sco.general). biz.sco.sources: SysV or BSD source code for useful programs and utilities, modified to compile and run with various incarnations of SCO Xenix, UNIX, and/or OpenDesktop. biz.sco.binaries: Binary packages compiled from SCO compatible source code, often from source posted in biz.sco.sources and often installable using the SCO "custom" utility. biz.sco.magazine: Interaction between the SCO Magazine readers, writers and publishers. You should always endeavour to post your article to the most applicable newsgroup. For example, posting your ODT question to the "general" newsgroup will preclude your question and answers to it from being saved in the public ODT archives. Appropriate crossposting is allowed.

182	From: gowen@jade.tufts.edu (G. Lee Owen) Subject: XDM, Xkernel, and olwm Lines: 33 Organization: Tufts University - Medford, MA Distribution: na Greetings, We have a network of ~20 Sun Workstations, running SunOS 4.1.1 and Openwindows 3. 7 of these are Sun 3's that we have modified to run Seth Robertson's xkernel image, effectively turning them into xterminals. We use xdm (X11R4) to manage the displays. When we had 3 xkernel machines, things worked fine, but when we installed 4 more last weekend, we appear to have found a weakness. With 7 clients to 1 Sparc 2, the Sparc 2 window manager is eventually getting munged. Let me try to be precise: The user sitting at the machine that does all the actual processing for these xterminals is having control of his keyboard and screen yanked away. (When this was the department chair, it was kind of cute). We poked at xdm for a few days and are satisfied that it is not at fault. Our current theory is that olwm (the Sun version) was not meant for running multiple copies on one machine (which is what happens -- the console user runs olwm, and every xterminal logged in has olwm running on the xterminal server). Has anyone had any prior experience with this sort of behavior? Can anyone shoot obvious holes in this theory? How about obvious gimmes? And, of course, any ideas on how to solve it? Any ideas are greatly appreciated. Greg Owen { gowen@forte.cs.tufts.edu, gowen@jade.tufts.edu } Systems Programmer and TA, Tufts University Computer Science Dept.

Methods to automatically passwd Authorization from one machine to another. This also includes the problem of notifing the remote host of the current DISPLAY that is being used. 1/ Use rsh/rexec/on... (the method in the xauth manual) Set up the your .rhosts file in the home directory on the remote machine so that a password in not required to remotly execute commands. xauth extract - $DISPLAY | rsh other xauth merge - This method is also used by xrsh to pass authorization. My vampire program also uses a variation, however I wrap it as part of the remote command sequence (EG: xauth add $auth) Included in this method is the use of `xrlogin' and `xrsh' to do this job for you. These programs usally (the newer ones that is) allow you to pass a secified list of ENVIRONMENT variables which includes the `DISPLAY' and/or a copy of the authorization code required. The `xon' program available (if enabled) on sun machines will also pass environment variables, as well as the current directory. You will however be required to store the Authority in such a variable for passing. Unless you are also have shared home directories. WARNING: Environment variables and command line arguments are visible in `ps' listing with the appropiate flags. As such passing authorization information in environment variables or as arguments is not recomended. The recommended method as given in the manual (shown above) is safe from the view of other users. 2/ Wrap it as part of the TERM environment variable. This method uses the fact that most remote command executors do pass the TERM environment variable to the remote host. It is then a matter of an appropiate script in your remote .login file to extract the information from the TERM environment variable and set up things appropiatly. A version of the xrlogin script is available on the network which does this. Basically you change the TERM environment variable before the actual call to rlogin is performed, to include your DISPLAY and your authorization. On the remote machine you then extract this information and return the TERM environment variable to normal BEFORE you use it for reseting or stty'ing your terminal. ---8<--- script for launching rlogin: #!/bin/sh # ~/bin/rl --- Rlogin with display: if [ -n "$DISPLAY" ]; then case "$DISPLAY" in :*) DISPLAY=`hostname`$DISPLAY ;; esac TERM="$TERM&$DISPLAY&`xauth nextract - $DISPLAY`" export TERM fi rlogin $* ---8<--- add to your .cshrc or .login if ( $?TERM ) then if ( `echo $TERM | tr -cd '&'` != '' ) then echo "$TERM" | cut '-d&' -f3 | xauth nmerge - setenv DISPLAY `echo "$TERM" | cut '-d&' -f2` setenv TERM `echo "$TERM" | cut '-d&' -f1` endif endif ---8<--- xterm command to use xterm -T hostname -e ~/bin/rl hostname ---8<--- 3/ NFS. Write it to a file on a shared NFS partition you have access to. Note that if the home directories are NFS mounted, then authorization is automatically passed, Hoever you will still have to pass your DISPLAY environment variable via a file or other means. IE: login host: echo $DISPLAY > ~/.X11host remote host: setenv DISPLAY `cat ~/.X11host` 4/ Finger for the info in a .plan file This involves encrypting the information into your `.plan' or `.project' and having the remote machine finger for the information. This has the disadvantage of having the information to anyone fingering the user. Thus requiring a encryption method that is uniq to each individual. IE: the method of decyrption must not be shared or known by others, nor should it be easy to determine. A improvment is to use the `who fingered me' technique to only give the information only to your own remote accounts and not just to anyone who is asking. This last method was developed last year by a second year here, untill I explained to him the need for the encryption, at which point he gave up this method. It is however a valid method. It is easer than (2) but less secure.

I'm wanting to connect a digitiser made for PCs into my workstation (an HP 720). It is my understanding the X windows can understand a variety of input devices including digitiser tablets. However, this digitiser makes use of the serial port, so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver. The HP manual pages say that the HP X server will accept X input from devices listed in the /usr/lib/X11/X*devices file (* = display number). I shouldn't think I would be able to simply insert /dev/rs232c as an input device in this file and expect a digitiser to work. But maybe I'm wrong. Am I? What I would like to know is: does anybody out there have a digitiser connected to their workstation for use as a pointer for X (rather than just as input to a specific X application)? If so, what were the steps required for installation? Did you need a special device driver? Did the manufacturer supply it? Are there generic public domain device drivers around? (I understand that digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats.) Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Anyway, what you say is not really true. The color information is associated with a GraphicsContext, not with a display, and the GC _IS_ a parameter to the drawing routines. So, if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of width 2, you can make 2 GCs for those cases and then simply do XDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_red,x1,y1,x2,y2); XDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_blue,x3,y3,x4,y4); for this effect. This is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer, but also much more efficient and flexible. You would not include all the other parameters like line pattern, with, cap and joinstyle, drawmode and so on in every drawing call, so why do it for color ? BTW, stay away from XDrawPoint() if you don't really need it (to draw RANDOM points), for image transfers there are Image routines. -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o | \\\- Brain Inside -/// | o | | o | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ | o | | o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+	4

The tools I have looked at so far are UIM/X, X-designer, Tele-Use, tcl/tk,Interviews, and SUIT. So far I've drawn the following conclusions: 1) The builder for Interviews is not very mature, bad docs 2) Tele-Use is very expensive and uses a proprietary toolkit 3) UIM/X & X-designer seem about the same, even though X-designer does not have a interpreter (I'll by Centerline if I need one) 4) tcl/tk is a little buggy 5) I know very little about the ICS Builder (just have the sales info) 6) Due to a corporate agreement X-designer is much cheeper than any other comercial product. 7) For the time I'm spending I could have bought all of them (well different money) 8) We will have to live with any shortcomings and make it work 9) this type of tool seems great, but noone seems to talk about them on the net.

Lines: 38 NNTP-Posting-Host: blade.stack.urc.tue.nl X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6] I am looking for a program to draw various kinds of diagrams on my Linux system. - It must be free. - It must run on standard (monochrome) X with a small screen size (800x600) No motif/openlook etc. - It must compile under Linux with gcc/g++. Most generic unix software works ok. - It must produce postscript files that I can include into LaTeX documents with dvips. Or just tell me another free program that converts one of the supported formats to ps. - It must produce drawings that are larger than the window size (scrollable). I know of several such programs, idraw, xfig. tgif. I have no experience with any of them. Features I would like in the programs are. - ability to draw circles, arcs, straight lines, boxes and arrows. - support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects. - support for texts in any size. - ability to move/copy/resize/rotate any part of the drawing. - ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component (e.g. a transistor symbol composed of three lines, an arrow and a circle) - any aid (numeric coordinates, screen grid) to align parts of the drawing. - less essential, but in fact very handy: preservation of connection. If I move one part of the drawing, the lines that connect that part to the rest of the drawing, stay connected. Ideally I want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable to draw electronic schematics, flow charts, logic diagrams, data flow diagrams and block diagrams with it. I just want to know which of the programs offer which of the features on my whishlist and are there any other programs? How demanding are the programs with respect to disk space, memory and CPU usage? Are any of the programs known to work on Linux with monochrome X? Lennart.	4

204	From: jc@minya.UUCP (John Chambers) Subject: painting with increasing resolution Lines: 40 Some people working a few cubes over have come up with this need, and it seems that someone out there just might have done it already, and can point me to some tools that would help. What they'd like to do is: Given a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either the data is arriving over a slow link, or the $DISPLAY is across a slow link), they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of the picture, and then repaint it in higher resolution. Thus, the picture might first be generated in 1/4 resolution, with each 4x4 square of pixels being filled in with a single color. Next, each 4x4 square would be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version would be painted. Since one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side of a slow link, the low-res version obviously wouldn't be transmitted as a bitmap; that wouldn't help at all. Instead, there would have to be a process on the far end that receives the low-res picture as a small bitmap, and blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the magnifier programs do). This brings up the question of whether the X server can help. That is, when a window is opened, is there a way to ask that a "filter" program be run to process the pixels? Or is the only way to use something like rsh to start up a remote process ("Permission denied" ;-), and have it open a local window? It seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts up such a program remotely, and then accepts bitmaps, compressing each one by some amount, and sending them to the remote program to expand. But if there is something that X itself can do to help, it's be nice to hear about it. (I looked in several FMs, but if it's there, I obviously don't know the keywords ;-). If someone has a nifty tool available that packages it all, we might want to get a copy. Oh, yes; this is to run on some Suns. Part of the idea is to build demos that can show such things as "If this were run across, say, a 4800-bps link, this is how fast the pictures would appear." Then the customer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for. -- If the auto industry were like the computer industry, a car would now cost $5, would get 5000 miles to the gallon, and at random times would explode, killing all its passengers.	4

Since I don't think Tom always gets time to read this group, I'll take the liberty of responding to some of this. If you really want Tom to reply you should send mail to support@qdeck.com. A 64k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 10mbps ethernet that we typically run. How restrictive it will be depends on what you run and how you run it. I would think that a couple of instances of some really nasty program like "Smoking Clover" would make the link useless for anyone else. On the other hand, probably 50 xclocks quietly updating every 10 seconds or so wouldn't impact it too much. In the real world, you will be somewhere in between these two extremes. Going by the way I personally use X on a daily basis, I wouldn't want to have to share that 64k link with more than 3-4 other people. >>Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding >>in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of >>thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before >>you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth). > >Hmmm.

What size link do you have (2Mb or 10Mb ?). >What is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you >have few high peaks and then many low points? Our corporate WAN is as unique as any other. The usage patterns are not very good predictors of how yours will behave. The only one of our low bandwidth links that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to Ireland that they often use to run a DOS text based client end of a client-server database remotely from the DVX machine behind me. Since the server end is (or was) always at this end (California) it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview X and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having a long hop to the server. As I warned you, this tells us very little about how you usage pattern will fill a 64k ISDN link. Running Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent. Let's break it into pieces and look at it. Tracking the mouse pointer is easy and efficient to translate from Windows calls into X. Popping up a menu is a little more involved and will generate some traffic. Restoring the screen that was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be. Does the server that it's displaying on have backing store? If so and the server had enough memory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network traffic. If no backing store, then what was being covered up? If it was a solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite easily. If it was a full color backdrop of Ren & Stimpy we may have to send it back to the X server bit by bit. DVX will do its level best to only redraw that small area, but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be repainted. Assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that's 3145728 bits that has to be sent. Worst possible case you're looking at about 50 seconds. In reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts that will be tranlatable into higher level X calls. > > >>It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going >>to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all >>doing network things also...) >>-- > >What do you mean by network things?

X was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network. It's pretty good for this. X programs are best, DOS text programs are almost as good (since we conert them to X easily). Something like WinX is a hybrid. We intercept the calls Windows makes to it's graphics driver/ mouse driver keyboard driver and convert them to X. The calls Windows is making are in no way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network.

I have the following in my .Xdefaults: XTerm*Font : -adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-140-75-75-m-90-iso8859-1 So I believe that I have the correct font selected to use in xterm. I have NOT set my LC_CTYPE environment variable because whatever I put it, it tells me that that locale is not supported (apparently we have no additional locales defined, or at least, /lib/locale doesn't exist). I can get some of the characters above 127 to print out, but they are not where I'd expect them -- for example, Alt-v does not produce a u umlaut. This leads me to believe that the fault lies with the stty settings, which are as follows: speed 9600 baud; line = 0; susp <undef>; dsusp <undef> intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^H; kill = ^K; swtch = ^@ eof = ^D; eol = ^@; min = 4; time = 0; stop = ^S; start = ^Q -parenb -parodd cs8 -cstopb hupcl cread -clocal -loblk -crts -ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr icrnl -iuclc ixon -ixany ixoff -ienqak isig icanon iexten -xcase echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh opost -olcuc onlcr -ocrnl -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel -tostop Anyway, I've struggled with this off and on for a couple of weeks, and any help anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated.

Organization: Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) Lines: 42 Distribution: world NNTP-Posting-Host: spcsun18.bbn.com I have found a situation which I think is a bug in X or Motif, but I'm hoping is really just a mistake on my part. Does anyone know anything about this problem........ - I am using an XmTextField, and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded text string (ascii or Kanji) either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString. The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed, the text is getting truncated, depending on the setting of the environment variables LANG (more specifically LC_ALL). When they are set to japanese, the text gets truncated. When they are set to english, everything works fine. I am taking the default for XmNcolumns. (Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual application, just in my sample code to make things easier) - I am running Motif 1.2, X11R5 via HPUX9.01. My test program is set up to handle 16 bit Kanji characters. I have remembered to do XtSetLanguageProc() prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources are set to japanese fonts. - Don't know if this matters, but my dialog box and TextField is initially created with UIL. The problem does NOT happen with XmText. Unfortunately substituting XmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable alternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!) I have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone wants it. My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not properly allocating memory for japanese, but since I don't have the source to look at it is just a guess. Please let me know if this sounds familiar, or if you have a suggestion, or if you want the sample program. THANKS!!!!!!!! - Susan swalker@bbn.com 617-873-8190	4

The ICS Widget databook is a subscription kind of thing, where you pay some nominal fee, get a cd with the widgets and then you can use the public domain widgets freely, and selectively activate widgets which you want to purchase the right to use from them. The nice thing about this is that you can purchase whole sets of widgets such as those used in dataviews. I dont know there pricing schemes but It is often better to buy than to redevelop the more complex widgets, especially if you only one customer to distribute to.

The best way to do this is by logging in over the network and typing: truss -t open Xsun open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/misc/fonts.dir", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8 open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/misc/fonts.alias", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8 open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/fonts.dir", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8 open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/fonts.alias", O_RDONLY, 0666) Err#2 ENOENT open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/fonts.dir", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8 open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/fonts.alias", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8 open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/fonts.dir", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8 open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/fonts.alias", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8 open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/misc/6x13.pcf", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8 open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/misc/cursor.pcf", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8 This will give you and idea of where Xsun things the fonts should be. If you have defined a project root and done a make install, everything should have gone right by default, even without symbolic links. Casper	4

These are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the performance of your workstation. Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more hardware is always even a necessity. This "FAQ" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE. Performance is a highly subjective issue. The individual user must balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal decision. Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts. This document is specifically concerned with X. There are of course many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation. However, they are outside the scope of this document. [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system performance, might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook "System Performance Tuning" by Mike Loukides. IMHO, it contains a well-written, comprehensive treatment of system performance. I'm unaware of any other similar books. --ed.] ----------------- Table of Contents ----------------- 0.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few months old (see the "Last-modified" date above) you should probably locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.

If you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by sending a mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the command "send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups" in the message body. ----------------------------- What about the "Other X FAQ"? ----------------------------- David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and well written "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" document. Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates on performance. The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with regards to the X server. The gist of that topic seems to be: "Use X11R5, it is faster than R4". (Please see the X FAQ for complete details). --------------- Window Managers --------------- There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different features and abilities. The choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features. At this point, most respondents have agreed upon "twm" as the best candidate for a speedy window manager. A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger, is turning off unnecessary things like "zooming" and "opaque move". Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows. Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen) and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the display with no overlap. Other font suggestions will be accepted. ------------ The X Server ------------ Which Server? - - - - - - - Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware. If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server. On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging. [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk), Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ] How your server was compiled can also make a difference. Jeff Law (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler. You can expect to get "*very* large speedups in the server" by not using the bundled SunOS compiler. I assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial compilers on the market. Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and does not get paged? eg: via a call to plock(). Does this help performance at all? I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone who's tried it. I am not in a position to give it a try. [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com), Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be), Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep for a second or two after launching each one. After I changed my .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time... we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though. This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works! Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of why this works, which I have summarized here: When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections. A lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts. This process touches a large number of pages. Any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory. If you put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up. Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources being fetched, programs initializing state and "databases" and so forth. All this activity is typically memory intensive. Once this initialization is done ("The process has reached a steady state"), the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages. By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation's limited resources This is most definitely a "Your Mileage May Vary" situation, as there are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients you are starting, etc. Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & I've experimented with: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 3; exec xterm ) & (sleep 4; exec xterm ) & I've even tried: (sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) & and then in start_X_clients_script I had: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down into a "steady state" before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched. ] All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with my current setup, for its simplicity. You will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you. Fonts - - - Loading fonts takes time and RAM. If you minimize the number of fonts your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time. One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts. Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server. This will also conserve server resources, since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server. [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au), Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ] eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all it's menus and icons etc. Twm's default font is 8x13. Since I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server. Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com): Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs. If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server. About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - - Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small. Saves RAM and saves on server startup time. Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) One suggestion: In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications. For example: *reverseVideo: true Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific resource files. For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults. In your .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH: setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N [ The "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" FAQ contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work. --ed.] So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from .../app-defaults/XTerm. Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi, and so on and so forth. Note that not all clients follow the same XXxxx resource-file naming pattern. You can check in your system app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files with the same name. This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666). [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com), Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov), and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu). Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.] This method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits: - Easier to maintain / more usable. - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property. As a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources. - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them. It also has drawbacks: - the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up. This doesn't seem to make that much of a performance difference, and you might consider this a huge boon to usability. If you are modifying an application's resource database, you just need to re-run the application without having to "xrdb" again. - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp. When your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not. WATCH OUT FOR THIS!! I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped out. When I switched to this method of distributed resource files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources. Xt did *NOT* provide any error message when it encountered the C style comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted processing the resource file. The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management. - You may also run into some clients which break the rules. For example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults. - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored, your client will not find its resources. Loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources. Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying) is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my .Xdefaults file, and to use the "separate resources files" method for clients that I seldom use. Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server. In that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to "<hostname>:0.0", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you should set your DISPLAY variable to "unix:0.0" or ":0.0". By doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests. [thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)] See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further explanation of how to properly set your display name. "I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when the DISPLAY isn't set specially." Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET) [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set. I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here. Hopefully MIT will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves. In the meantime, if you want to try it yourself, email Jody. --ed.] ------- Clients ------- If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think carefully about the number of programs you are running. Think also about the _kind_ of programs you are running. For example: Is there a smaller clock program than xclock? Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word. [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome. --ed.] I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject of X client programs. Some advocate the use of programs that are strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather large. Others warn us that other applications which you are using may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries. In this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed. The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits. That is, try and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif clients, etc). If you use more than one, then you're dragging in more than one toolkit library. Know your environment, and think carefully about which client programs would work best together in that environment. [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET), Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ] A Better Clock for X - - - - - - - - - - - 1) xcuckoo suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk) available: on export.lcs.mit.edu Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program. Saves screen real estate. 2) mclock suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU) available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar Non Xt-based. Extensively configurable. it can be made to look very much like MIT oclock, or mostly like xclock purely by changing resources. Of course, the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources, and takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall. :-) A Better Terminal Emulator for X - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - From the README file distributed with xterm: +----- | Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here | | This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution. | ... +----- Ugly maybe, but at my site it's still the most used. I suspect that xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites. Laziness? Isn't there a better terminal emulator available? See below. If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines to reduce memory usage. [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com), Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ] 1) Xvt suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) : available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z "...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get hold of xvt ... it was written here just to save swap space as xterm is rather a hog! " This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm. You don't have to rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm. In it's current version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm. I've heard that there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any yet. UPDATE (March 1993): I recently had a few email conversations with Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt. He questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm. For instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster. Also, while xterm may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major. As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets brought into memory. So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of xvt over xterm. In summary? Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary. If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it. Specifically: How much RAM each occupies, how much swap each needs, relative speed of each 2) mterm suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU) available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax. "I also have my own terminal emulator. Its major lack is scrollback, but some people like it anyway." Tuning your client - - - - - - - - - - Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster. From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif Text Field Widgets: I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes, particularly the initial one in the field. Examining the what was going on with xscope I found it. It seems that when the resource XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink. Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea). The user can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0. It is not noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference on a [slower system]. This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots of areas. Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server requests? ------------------------- Miscellaneous Suggestions ------------------------- Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - - Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds. - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc) - These take up RAM, and CPU power. I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window. I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by having a full screen root image on a colour workstation. - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway. [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) for reminding me of this one. --ed.] A Quicker Mouse - - - - - - - - Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen when you move your mouse. I use "xset m 3 10" in my .xinitrc file, which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of the wrist. See the xset man page for further ideas and information. Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for fine work. To cover my options, I have placed a number of different mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager. e.g. (for twm) : menu "mouse settings" { "Mouse Settings:" f.title " Very Fast" ! "xset m 7 10 &" " Normal (Fast)" ! "xset m 3 10 &" " System Default (Un-Accelerated)" ! "xset m default &" " Glacial" ! "xset m 0 10 &" } Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of things you can do. Some that stick out: - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager widget. Again, stick to as few fonts as possible. - Better yet, don't use Motif at all. It's an absolute pig. - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly. Try to reuse them. (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.) - Use a line width of 0 in GCs. On some servers this makes a HUGE difference. - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events. This can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one. Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) : Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc function would greatly increase performance of Xt based applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster) [ Any confirmation on this from anyone? --ed.] Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) : - Unnecessary NoExpose Events. Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to run through it's event-loop again and again. - Thousands of XChangeGC requests. This "Gfx Context Switching" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps, where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed again and again. Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase). Say What!? - - - - - - Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first: David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) : How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the same operation between client and server. I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received the following confirmation... Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se): I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was essential when I only had 8 MB. Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) : [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as your server when you run it on the same machine. Not really a major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing. Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) : Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's cpu usage is bursty. so the chances of you and your teammate doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your action. The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2 cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing even fewer context switches. ---------------------------- Other Sources of Information ---------------------------- Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read. Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com): A lot more tips on performance are in the paper "Improving X Application Performance" by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang, in Issue 3 of The X Resource. An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992 conference proceedings. This paper is absolutely essential reading for X programmers. -------------- Author & Notes -------------- This list is currently maintained by Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca) Suggestions, corrections, or submission for inclusion in this list are gladly accepted.

Lines: 30 Distribution: world NNTP-Posting-Host: helios.ath.epa.gov Thanks to Bruce Barnett, who recommended xvttool, and Bernward Averwald and Liam Quin, who recommended modifying .Xdefaults to get the desired behavior for a *class* of xterms. In xvttool, simply create a key file that looks like: "a" "A" "b" "B" "c" "C" ... and specify said key file on the command line. This will translate any input into any other (in my case, lo-case to up-case). Works great, and you get a customizable button-pad on the right or left side. To use an xterm solution, add to your .Xdefaults: capxterm*VT100.Translations: #override \ <Key>a: string("A")\n\ ... or: capxterm.vt100.translations: #override \n\ <Key>a: insert-string(A) \n\ <Key>b: insert-string(B) \n\ ... and invoke as: xterm -name capxterm Thanks loads! -- Kevin Weinrich Computer Sciences Corp. kbw@helios.ath.epa.gov	4

There was the possibility that it was going to be changed so that if the file wasn't DSC compliant that it would stop at each showpage. I believe that this method would preclude being able to go backwards and forwards through the file, i.e., you could only go forward to the next showpage.

Ghostview is a postscript previewer that uses ghostscript. From the ghostview README: Ghostview -- An X11 user interface for ghostscript. Ghostview is full function user interface for ghostscript 2.4. Brief list of features: - Ghostview parses any known version of Adobe's Document Structuring Conventions. - Page size is automatically determined from the Document Structuring Comments. The user is able to override the values from the comments. - Window size is set to the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript figures. - Default page size is Letter and can be changed via Xresources or application defaults file to A4 (or any other valid size) for our European friends. - Scrollbars appear when necessary. - Page orientation is automatically determined from the Document Structuring Comments. The user is able to override the values from the comments. - Ability to view at 4 orientations: Portrait, Landscape, Upside-down, and Seascape (for those who rotate landscape the other direction). - Ability to preview in any supported visual. (Can preview in gray-scale or color on a Color monitor.) - Ability to mark pages for printing, or saving. (Good for people that printed a 100 page document and lost page 59 due to a printer jam.) - Can popup zoom windows at printer resolution (1 display dot = 1 printer dot). The Ghostview distribution includes a Ghostview Widget that people are encouraged to use in other programs. Ghostview-1.3 is available via anonymous ftp from: prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z appenzell.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z From the ghostscript README: ***************************************************** * This file describes version 2.4.1 of Ghostscript. * ***************************************************** ******** ******** An overview of Ghostscript ******** ******** Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides: - An interpreter for the Ghostscript language, which very closely resembles the PostScript (TM) language; and - A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that implement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive operations in the Ghostscript language. The Ghostscript language interpreter and library are written entirely in C, with some assembly-language accelerators for MS-DOS platforms. Currently, Ghostscript is known to run on the following platform families: - IBM PC and compatibles with EGA, VGA, SuperVGA, or compatible graphics under MS-DOS 3.1, 3.3, or 5.0; - A wide variety of Unix systems using X Windows version 11, release 3, 4, and 5, including Sun-3, Sun-4, Sun-386i, Sun SPARCStation 1; generic 80386 machines running 386/ix; H-P 9000/300 and 9000/800; DECStation 2100 and 3100; VAX running Ultrix; Sequent Symmetry; Convex C1 and C2; Tektronix 4300; SGI Iris Indigo; - Sun workstations (Sun-3, SPARC, Sun-386i) running SunView; - VAX, VMS with X11R3/4/5, gcc and DEC C compiler (DEC C compiler version 3.1 or later is required).

Lines: 42 Extract from the color README file for Anthony's Icon Library. For Network discussion... Color Coordination... I tried to start a discussion in `comp.windows.x' at the start of the year about some sort of `standard color table' that icons should follow (say 16 to 32 colors including 5 colors for a small grey scale). but no one responded at all. The problem is that if the colors for icons are just used willy-nilly you will soon find that the workstations color table, devotes itself solely the window manager, icons and other `adminstrative tasks' instead of applications that actually require the colors for proper working. ``Color needful applications'' such as : Picture and graphic displayers, Animation, Real Time video, Raytracers, etc... . The following is a suggested color table for icons, and general use. Icons, Window Managers, and general applications, should follow this table or something like it, UNLESS the application is ``color needful''. * for each primary color (red,green,blue) three colors EG: values 0, 128 and 255. This results in 3 ^ 3 colors (27) representing most of the standard colors for use in icons. * two extra shades of grey EG: vales (black) 0, 64, 128, 196 and 255 (white,red,...) * 3 other colors -- probably of some primary color to provide shading a and 3-D look to buttons and titlebars in the window manager. This table represents 32 colors and represents a large range of posibilities for the above ``administrative services'' of the workstation.

These include: object oriented technologies such as the Object Management Group's ORB and CORBA; C++ as it applies to X; client server technologies such as DCE; threads; databases- object oriented and relational; and (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) Windows NT. With the bulk of the Xhibition audience (and the UNIX community) developing applications for in-house or custom use, a new 32-bit operating system from a player as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated. With MS Windows on so many desktops, and the price of computing power dropping, its successor needs to be evaluated. As corporations begin to look at NT, so must their developers and suppliers. The mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide information to the application developer and to the technology planner. The NT Conference at Xhibition is designed to do just that. We worked with Microsoft to provide the *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIX developers the capabilities of Windows and NT. If you aren't sure that NT has what you need for your application development or systems deployment, this is the place to find out. Ask the folks from Microsoft, get them to show you what you need. Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development Kits- to bang on, evaluate, and generally to see for yourself. I hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial (it should sound like an Xhibition commercial:-). I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audience is growing and Xhibition is growing along with it. The industry is a confusing place at the moment with UNIX, COSE, NT, DCE, CORBA, and all of the other acronyms sprouting up. Xhibition can help sort out the confusion. -Aub Harden Technical Program Manager harden@ics.com X H I B I T I O N The Conference and Trade ****** ***** Show for Corporate * * * Software Development ****** *** * * 201 Broadway *** ***** Cambridge, MA 02139 Windows on Distributed Computing June 7 - 11, San Jose, CA xhibit@ics.com uunet!ics.com!xhibit Voice: (617) 621-0060 Fax: (617) 621-9555 Presented by Integrated Computer Solutions, Inc.	4
257	From: jc@minya.UUCP (John Chambers) Subject: program to display .gif files? Lines: 17 It seems silly, but while I've located things like tgif that can edit gif files, and various tools to convert to/from gif format, I haven't been able to locate a program that just opens a window and displays a gif file in it. I've looked thru various faq files, also to no avail. Is there one lurking about in some archive? Nothing sophisticated; just "show the pretty picture"? Alternatively, if I could locate the specs for gif, I don't suppose it would be too hard to write it myself, but I have no idea where to even start looking for the spec. (Well, actually, I do have an idea - this newsgroup. ;-) -- If the auto industry were like the computer industry, a car would now cost $5, would get 5000 miles to the gallon, and at random times would explode, killing all its passengers.	4

261	From: mlt@blues.infores.com (Michael Turok) Subject: 'makedepend' problem Organization: Information Resources Inc. Lines: 46 Hi, netters: We have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process #if clause in C preprocessor statements. It evaluates everything to true no matter what the conditionals are. For example, makedepend chokes on one of X11 include files (as distributed by Sun) - namely Xos.h: #if !defined(SUNOS41) || defined(__STDC__) # include <string.h> # define index strchr # define rindex strrchr #else /* BSD && !__STDC__ */ # include <strings.h> #endif /* !SUNOS41 || __STDC__ */ Here 'makedepend' evaluates both #if and corresponding #else statements to 'true' and tries to open the file <strings.h> which doesn't exist under Solaris2. We also have a lot of #if statements in some of our legacy code. We got and built 'makedepend' off the net - it didn't fix the problem. In all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man-page (Sun's distribution) mentions this problem: BUGS If you do not have the source for cpp, the Berkeley C preprocessor, then makedepend will be compiled in such a way that all #if directives will evaluate to "true" regardless of their actual value. This may cause the wrong #include directives to be evaluated. Makedepend should simply have its own parser written for #if expressions. Has anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than WriteYourOwnParser... and willing to share it with us? Since we often experience delays in our newsfeed - please reply directly to my e-mail address -> I'll post a summary.

What is this link problem with libXmu on SunOS 4.1.[23]? In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts with the way X builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols, notably, to be undefined when building some X11 clients: _get_wmShellWidgetClass _get_applicationShellWidgetClass Compiling "-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic" appears to work. To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please contact your local Sun office and request the following patches: Patch i.d.

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers) ===================================================================== I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system? 1. Free options The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2. Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will be more difficult to compile. Information on how to obtain XFree86 is listed below. X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com). It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards. There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4, X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more). X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below). 2. Commercial options 1) Metro Link 2213 W.

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it? 3. What is XFree86? XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with X11R5. This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and other enhancements. Here are the highlights of the enhancements: 1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86, selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file. Some SpeedUps require an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of 1024. The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by default. With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2. 2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected. This mode is now equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately 20% faster than X386 1.2. 3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients, or both. This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4. For SVR4.0.4 with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported. 4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets. Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about the ATI and Trident drivers. 5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu). 6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is compile-time selectable. There are contributed Type1 fonts in the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu. 7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary distributions. 8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux. 9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA cards is now included. The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2 (they were not in XFree86 1.1): 1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 (see the X386(1) manual page for more information). 2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a "two headed" server - one VGA, and one Hercules. So far this has only been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux). 3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1. 4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for more information.) 5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some versions of these devices were not previously compatible). 6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous documentation and a lot of experimentation). 7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more information). 8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of 0.1 MHz. Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server. 9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig configuration file. Error messages are much more informative and intuitive, and more validation is done. There are many new options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) manual page for more information on the format of this file). Plus a number of other small things. Refer to the CHANGELOG file in the source distribution for full details. Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat. 4. What OSs are supported? XFree86 supports: SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2 SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2 Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1 BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>. Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet, but anyone should feel free to submit patches. If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to xfree86@physics.su.oz.au 5. What video hardware is supported? At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets: Tseng ET4000 Tseng ET3000 Paradise PVGA1 Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of the PVGA1, and use its driver) Genoa GVGA Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000 ATI 18800, 28800 All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes, with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in 256 color mode. The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card. On the ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k. It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies. To avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86 1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel clock. This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are discovered. Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how these programs work, if you need to write one. If you do develop such a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with future XFree86 releases. If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86, it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the Orchid ProDesigner IIs. Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details. In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond products, as long as such policies remain in effect. Contributions of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities). If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it. Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It could be ISA, EISA, or local bus. What should matter is the chipset on the video card. Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested theory. However, we have yet to see any reports of things not working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86 working fine on them. 6. What about accelerated boards? At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc. This support is available in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4). An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux. Contact <hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux. A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu> or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86. 7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes? The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the 16-color modes. In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory contains 1 pixel. But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit- planes. Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes. The MIT frame- buffer code is not designed to deal with this. If VGA handled 16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure). But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer implementation is required. Some beta testers are looking into this, but nothing is yet available from the project. 8. What other hardware or software requirements are there? Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required. To run X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum. The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries). To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable lower bound. 9. Where can I get source for XFree86? Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22 from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from: export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86) ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86) ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86) (For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP) Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information on which files you need to get to build your distribution. 10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86? Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from: ftp.physics.su.oz.au - SVR4 binaries under /XFree86/SVR4 ftp.win.tue.nl - SVR4 binaries under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 ferkel.ucsb.edu - SVR4 binaries under /pub/SVR4/XFree86 stasi.bradley.edu - SVR4 binaries under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 blancmange.ma.utexas.edu - SVR3 (ISC) binaries under /pub/ISC ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de - SVR3 (ISC) binaries under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86 tsx-11.mit.edu - Linux binaries under /pub/linux/packages/X11 agate.berkeley.edu - 386BSD binaries under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86 ftp.cs.uwm.edu - Mach binaries under /i386 Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may archive older releases as well. Each binary distribution will contain a README file that describes what files you need to take from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were made when building the distribution. IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86? 11. Installation directories The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot (/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}. This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation. 12. Configuration files The XFree86 server reads a configuration file ("Xconfig") on startup. The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions. 13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings. The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated occasionally. Obtain a copy of this database. It just might have the settings you need. If you create new settings, please send them to David for inclusion in the database. If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings. It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use this description to get them right. When you do, send the information to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database. NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and is completely unnecessary. If you need to determine dot clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server. The server will probe for clocks itself and print them out. You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up starting the server in the future. 14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server. This is fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit. V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86? First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755). 15. SVR4 Why won't my xterm run properly? If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run. csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no' The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping problems with XFree86. It recommended that this patch not be installed. Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap. 16. SVR3 Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running. 17. 386BSD Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD. Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey <Rich@Rice.edu>. The latest version should be available in the file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites: agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 18. Linux You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc jump libraries installed. Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root. If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to run the server as "X -pn". The default startup configuration assumes that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files /usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the -pn argument to X386. Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but startx won't. When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with a tty, for example "xdm < /dev/console &". For more detailed information, please read the file README present with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu. 19. Mach Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach. VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source? This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs. Please look at those files for information on building XFree86. VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86? 20. BSD compatibility library A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc. The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(), seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include <X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them. Xfuncs.h provides macro definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions. If you are linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a 21. ANSICCOPTIONS This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite the entire CCOPTIONS line. For example, with stock MIT, you'd see something like CCOPTIONS="-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings" and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings" in his Imakefile. With this change, you would see a default of ANSICCOPTIONS="-ansi" CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings" and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is: ANSICCOPTIONS= to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death with -ansi). The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex. The other issue is that one must add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.

On the client side, I have tried with X11R4 Xlib on HP 9000-700 and DECstation, and with X11R3 Xlib on DECstation. All the combinations gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request. As far as I can tell from the manual, the only attribute which may give a BadMatch, is the colormap, if it belongs to a wrong visual. But the visual was correctly matched, as I did not get the error message. What am I doing wrong? For information I can tell that xwud aborts with the same error.

Organization: FWI, University of Amsterdam Lines: 35 NNTP-Posting-Host: ic.fwi.uva.nl Hi, I am running X11R4 on an IBM RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) and X11R5 on a Sun4 (SunOS 4.1). Since I run X on both colour and black&white displays, I need different values for the same resource, so I want to use #ifdef COLOR in my application defaults files. However, cpp is only invoked by xrdb, and not when the resources are loaded on demand. Is there a proper solution to this? So far, the only proper solution I've come to think of, is to create 2 different files in my ~/app-defaults/, say XTerm and XTerm-color, and set my XFILESEARCHPATH to either $HOME/%T/%N or $HOME/%T/%N-color. But that does not always seem to work (e.g. executing a remote shell command without reading the .cshrc does not set XFILESEARCHPATH). Furthermore, I thought of using #include "XTerm" in XTerm-color. However, for resources in XTerm that I want to override in XTerm-color, things are different on both machines. On a Sun, the FIRST found resource is used (i.e. the one from XTerm, the b&w one), while on an RS/6000, the LAST found value is used (i.e. the one from XTerm-color). What can I do about it? I have one last question: for the specification of XFILESEARCHPATH, I can use %T, %N, %C and %S. %T stands for app-defaults, %N for the resource class, but what do %C and %S stand for?

I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in. Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method. The rescale method invokes a "fake" Expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct) to draw the data. Quest 1. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.) I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed. I assume I'm getting cascading events. Is that right? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way? Quest 2. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events whatsoever. Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

So, you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them. In case it was not clear p_event->xevent.button is an int. By the way, you mentioned the Button1MotionMask and if anyone can help me with these MotionMasks I would be grateful. I can not figure out how do distinguish between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring. In essence I would like an seperate event-handler for motion with each button. Unfortunately, the XEvent sent by a MotionMask does not seem to contain the value of the pressed button. Any ideas, eps	4

The parent is very likely to grant this request, resulting in a > loss of the whole table from the display. > He isolated the problem a proposed a workaround which seems precisely correct. Here is the new implementation of XmpTableNewProposedLayout which will be released with the next update in 5 weeks: Xmp/Table.c: void XmpTableNewProposedLayout( tw ) XmpTableWidget tw; { XmpTableConsiderSameSize( tw ); XmpTableProposedColsAndRows( tw ); XmpTableQueryParentForResize( tw ); /* query only, no resize */ /* * Since we only made a query, we *should* still need to continue. * However, Motif is broken so that we actually may already have * been resized. In that case, the proposed layout is already * forgotten, so we should just quietly exit. */ if ( tw->table.resize_status == RSdueToRequest ) { XmpTableMakeColsFitQueryWidth( tw ); XmpTableMakeRowsFitQueryHeight( tw ); XmpTableGetProposedChildSize( tw ); XmpTableSaveProposedLayout( tw ); } /* else the resize has already been done. Our proposed layout would * have been forgotten in the process. */ } The XpTable the fix is identical, except of course for the names: Xp/Table.c: void XpTableNewProposedLayout( tw ) XpTableWidget tw; { XpTableConsiderSameSize( tw ); XpTableProposedColsAndRows( tw ); XpTableQueryParentForResize( tw ); /* query only, no resize */ /* * Since we only made a query, we *should* still need to continue. * However, some manager widgets are broken so that we actually may * already have * been resized. In that case, the proposed layout * is already forgotten, so we should just quietly exit. */ if ( tw->table.resize_status == RSdueToRequest ) { XpTableMakeColsFitQueryWidth( tw ); XpTableMakeRowsFitQueryHeight( tw ); XpTableGetProposedChildSize( tw ); XpTableSaveProposedLayout( tw ); } /* else the resize has already been done.

If you start it with -indirect localhost, it use the loopback adress as it's adress. So when it try to contact another host, this one try to answer on its loopback adress. Not good.

It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets. Xm++ was initially created for the Motif widget set, now support for the Athena widgets was added. Applications created with Xm++ run in both environments without changes, although many nice features are only available when using Motif. In some situations Xm++ extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providing a ComboBox borrowed from MS-Windows), but never tries to replace it - data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated in rare cases. Xm++ has nothing common with Motif++ besides the general idea to encapsulate Motif widgets in C++ objects and the '++' in it's name. Many ideas for the Xm++ architecture came from Digitalk's Smalltalk version, which provides an easy to use framework for Windows/PM/Mac applications (in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor and a simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm++ dialogs :-). Top level objects in Xm++: * 'Windows', 'SystemDialogs' and 'ToolBoxes' which use the automatic layout feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw * 'UserDialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this distribution) Controls (children of top level objects): 'staticText', 'staticImage', 'pushButton', 'checkBox', 'radioButton', 'edit', 'listBox', 'comboBox', 'groupBox', 'paneArea', 'drawing', 'toolBar' The staticImage and all the button classes can display b/w (X-bitmap format) or color (GIF format) pictures as an alternative to a label text. Event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects Xt callbacks to member functions of Xm++ objects. CommonInteract(II) is built upon the Xm++ drawing class and provides components for building direct manipulative applications. Is is a very simplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system (research project of our institute in 1991), an approach to define a software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications with multiple interaction media (i.e. sound, alternative input devices). If you are interrested, look into the June 1993 issue of the JOOP (SIGS Publications - Journal of Object Oriented Programming) - there should be our paper about CommonInteract (but be aware, that it is our 'state of the art' from 1991). CommonInteract(II) is still undocumented and is included because it was used to implement the dialog editor. It currently supports only drawing primitives (lines, rectangles, circles...), but we plan to extend it to support bitmaps and some controls also. Known problem: the Xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy (always redraws the whole window, even after minimal changes like selecting an object), this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed. About this first release: Xm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here for smaller applications which are running without problems. So I think I can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications for any non-critical purposes. CommonInteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. It's development will be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research project here. Besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems to be stable and can be used for experimental applications. Platforms: this release was compiled and tested on: HP9000/720 running HP-UX 8.07 SUN SPARC running SunOS Release 4.1.1 PC-AT386 running Linux v0.99pl6 Caution: although the whole stuff was initially developed using an AT&T standard C++ compiler - this release is tested only with GNU g++ 2.3.3 or above (the next release will be tested with both compilers).

Use Snapshot to convert the *.GIF to a Sun rasterfile. 8. Use IconEdit to touch it up and convert it to an X bitmap. 9. Use "vi" (yes, a *text* editor) to manually convert the rasterfile into the "Uncompressed X-Face" format.

In the list you mentioned, tgif handles everything except rotation and any size text. It only supports 90 degrees rotation. Currently, it supports 11 (X11R4 standard) font sizes. However, it allows arbitrary scaling of the entire drawing. Effectively, it allows any font sizes, but you can only have 11 different sizes per drawing. Tgif takes up 850K (compiled with -O option) on a SPARCstation. I was told that it compiles under Linux, but I haven't tried it yet. It works with both color and monochrome X. -- Bill Cheng // UCLA Computer Science Department // (310) 645-8328 3564-C Boelter Hall // Los Angeles, California 90024 // USA william@CS.UCLA.EDU ...!{uunet|ucbvax}!cs.ucla.edu!william	4

I have already recompiled my kernel and the german keyboard in the textmode works just fine. I have found out, that there is a preconfigured german keymap for X called Xmodmap.gr in /usr/lib/X11, so I ran xmodmap /usr/lib/X11/Xmodmap.gr. My first impression was very good, I was able to get Z and Y straight :) There's still a little problem I can't solve however: I cannot get at the backslash, bar, brackets and curly brackets. The ALT-GR key doesn't seem to work. I tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does. Looking up its keycode (113) in the Xmodmap I found the entry "Mode_switch" which doesn't ring any bell. The entries for the keys I cannot use seem to be correct. Example: keycode XX = ssharp questn backslash The first 2 entries I can even get at. The first one is the unmodified key and the second is the key with shift, but what is the 3rd?? My guess is that it should be the key with ALT-GR but it isn't. If anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them, help would be appreciated. CU Alaric	4

It trys to be intelligent about what it's doing so that you should be able to type "rx host.domain.etc", and get a xterm running on "host.domain.etc", with all the difficult stuff taken care of. In theory, this program can do *everything* you ever wanted to do when you wanted to run a remote command in the background - it doesn't even need to be an X program.

X] X.SH DESCRIPTION XThe X.B rx Xprogram connect to the specified X.I host Xand executes the specified X.I command Xin the background, returning immediately. To allow the execution Xof X programs, it copies a number of environmental variables to Xthe remote session. If you omit X.IR command , Xthen rx will start an xterm on the remote host. The X.B rxterm Xvarient starts a remote xterm on a host, and also passes X.I args Xto the remote xterm as arguments. X.PP XShell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on the local Xmachine, while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote Xmachine. X.PP XIf the name of the file from which X.B rx Xis executed is anything other than ``rx,'' X.B rx Xtakes this name, stripped on a leading ``r'' as the command Xto run on the remote host, using any X.I command Xparameters as arguments for the remote command. X.PP XIf X.B rx Xthinks you are using X.B xauth Xbased X authorisation, and you are calling to a off-site host, or Xto a different username, it will attempt to copy an authorization Xkey to the remote account. Otherwise it will try to use X.B xhost(1) Xto grant access to the remote host. X.SH OPTIONS X.TP X.BI \-l " username" XUse X.I username Xas the remote username instead of your local username. In the absence Xof this option, the remote username is the same as your local username. X X.SH ENVIRONMENT XIf set, the values of PATH, DISPLAY, XENVIRONMENT, XAPPLRESDIR, XXFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, OPENWINHOME, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, Xand XAUTHORITY are exported to the remote program, unless the Xremote username is different, or the remote host is off-site, in which Xcase only DISPLAY is exported, with in all cases any variables named in the Xvariable RXENV. X.PP XThe DISPLAY variable is tweaked as appropriate, to contain as qualified Xa hostname as is needed. X.SH DIAGNOSTICS X.TP X.IB command ": don't recognise my name." X.B rx Xcannot decode the name it has been called under. In this case Xit prints a warning message, and continues, as normal. X.TP X.B "rx: usage: rx [-l username] hostname [args...]" XThis means it could not decode the arguments given to it. X.SH AUTHOR XDuncan Sinclair <sinclair@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk>, July 1992 X.br XOriginally based on a program with the same name from the X.B gwm Xdistribution. To distinguish this "rx" from other programs Xwith similar names, you should refer to this program as the X.B Glasgow X.BR rx . X.SH "SEE ALSO" XX(1), rsh(1), xterm(1), xauth(1), xhost(1), gwm(1) X.SH BUGS X.B Rx Xmakes a number of assumptions about the relationship between the Xlocal user, and the remote one, depending on whether the remote Xhost is onsite or not, and whether an alternative username was used Xor not. X.PP XIn particular, if either the locally used shell, or the remotely Xused shell is the standard Bourne Shell, X.B sh(1) Xthen strange things are more likely to happen. Especially when Xit's only one of them. X.PP XSometimes quoting can get messed up. X.PP XIt's too easy to fool the smarts in X.B rx Xto make it believe something that is not true, and fail because of it. X.PP XWhen X.B rx Xuses X.B xhost Xto grant access, the X.B xhost Xcommand may fail silently. X.PP XIf X.B rx Xtries to send to large a command to the remote machine, it will Xlikely fail with a parse error from csh. If this happens, you Xwill probably have to reduce the size of the exported environment.

At the same time, I try to make as few assumptions as possible X# about the remote machine. Here's a list of all the more tricky ones... X# *) That the remote machine has csh. (Linux?) X# *) That $RSHELL = /bin/(k)?sh ==> remote shell = /bin/(k)?sh. (Make same.) X# *) If remote shell = sh, that $PATH is compatible. (Use csh, etc..) X# *) I pass a cookie to the remote machine if need be, but does it X# know what to do with a cookie. (eat it?) X# *) There must be others... X############################################################################## X# Why am I using csh to run the remote commands? Simply because it doesn't X# interact badly with rsh, and hang waiting for a file descriptor to X# be closed. I'd rather use zsh, or bash, or even perl, but they are not X# as universal as csh.

Whenever I run xterm, I get the following message before the first C shell prompt: Warning: no access to tty; thus no job control in this shell... After this, I can't run any job control commands like fg, bg etc. Also, I can't run another xterm from the command line of this xterm (I can only launch additional xterms from a .mwmrc menu). I'd appreciate some help with this problem, or pointers to where I can get some help.

The window-manager is not responding because |> it thinks the window is already in the right place. |> |> Exactly *why* the two components get into this sulk is unclear to |> me; all information greatly received. This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents windows, a misfeature of the X protocol, and a bug in the Xt intrinsics. The Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the (x,y) position given in ReparentNotify events. Olwm is structured in such a way that, when a window is popped down, the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event. At this point, the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date. If a SetValues is done using the same (x,y) position, the Intrinsics thinks it needs to move the shell, so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it there. However, a (mis)feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow request that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event. The Intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive, and times out after wmTimeout has expired. (Actually, things are somewhat more complex because the request is redirected to the window manager, but the net result is the same.) The solution is for the Intrinsics to note the (x,y) positioning information in ReparentNotify events. This has been implemented and is available in X11R5 public fix 20. This is XBUG 5513 for those of you who are interested in gorier details. s'marks -- Stuart W. Marks stuart.marks@eng.sun.com Window Systems Technology 2550 Garcia Ave. M/S 21-228 SunSoft, Inc.

If you already own all the "clone" equipment then there are lots of such programs (see a current copy of Unix World Magazine). *BUT* your performance WILL suck lemons running an Xserver on a clone. (From experience). You would be much better off with an Xterminal if this is a new install. The performance will be at least four times better. In addition it would be MUCH easier to install and use. On top of that they will cost about the same (price a clone with 4MB RAM, ethernet card, very high performance graphics card, GOOD monitor, server software, TCP/IP for clone software, mouse, keyboard, etc, etc, etc.... you spend a whole lot of $$$$). I can get 15" Tektronix XP11 terminals for under $900, and the performance is over 80000 Xstones..... -- /--------------------------------------------------------------------------\ | Mark A.

I have been able to get the screen to blank out properly, and through debugging I can see that my savescreen function is being called with on=0, which (for some arcane reason) means to blank the screen. My problem is that this function is never being called again with on=1, even after I have moved the mouse and/or typed some keys. My question is: what am I likely to be missing that would cause this problem? I copied the basic design of my function from the existing versions: static Bool next_savescreen(scr,on) ScreenPtr scr; Bool on; { /* this was copied from the omron server code -- is it the right way? */ if (on != SCREEN_SAVER_ON) { nextSetLastEventTime(); } if (on == SCREEN_SAVER_ON) { /* Save user's current setting */ next_save_screen_brightness = NXScreenBrightness(my_eventhandle); NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle, 0.0); /* Blank the screen */ } else { /* Unblank the screen */ NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle, next_save_screen_brightness); } return TRUE; } I can see in the server/os code where the screensaver is called to turn on the saver, but I cannot find where it "wakes up" the server and unblanks the screen.

Use a workProc. See XtAppAddWorkProc(3Xt). You should split your drawing routnie up into small chunks (this is the hard part). Then, in the callback that starts the drawing, you call XtAppAddWorkProc() to call your workProc the first time. Your workProc should be a function that returns a boolean... TRUE when you are finished, and FALSE when you want to keep processing. If you return FALSE, the workProc is automatically re-installed. Note that this method is better that using a time-out loop, since events get processed in a more precedence-oriented manner. If you are using the same Ada bindings I am, however, you are hosed, and should look into XtAppAddTimeout(3Xt). ---------- Joe Hildebrand hildjj@fuentez.com Software Engineer Fuentez Systems Concepts (703)273-1447 Standard disclaimers apply	4

I am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client which is my X application will read. Now I have some doubts which you may be able to clarify. 1) When I fork a process. It will create to copy of my process. Right !! Now what does this two copies mean? Two Shells. Where should I fork my application. What are the responsibilities of this processes. How should I call this processes.? 2) Can I fork more than one processes. So that I can read from more than one servers input.

I am attempting to create user defined colors in terms of RGB color ranges. The calls to XAllocColor prove ineffective. Variables are defined are as follows: int i, j, k, lut_index color_type min_image, max_image; color_type image Pixel_Value_Range, last_image, start, end, jump, lut [ 512 ]; unsigned long pixel; double red, green, blue; /* * Data structure used by color operations * typedef struct { unsigned long pixel; unsigned short red, green, blue; char flags; /-* do_red, do_green, do_blue *-/ char pad; } XColor; ***************/ XColor rgbcolor, hardwarecolor; With color_type defined as { double red, double green, double blue }. What I need to know is how to set [is it possible] the values in hardwarecolor to work within the call to XAllocColor: start.red = (int) 255 * min_image.red; /* 0..255 */ end.red = (int) 255 * max_image.red; /* 0..255 */ jump.red = (int) (( end.red - start.red ) / 7); start.green = (int) 255 * min_image.green; /* 0..255 */ end.green = (int) 255 * max_image.green; /* 0..255 */ jump.green = (int) (( end.green - start.green ) / 7); start.blue = (int) 255 * min_image.blue; /* 0..255 */ end.blue = (int) 255 * max_image.blue; /* 0..255 */ jump.blue = (int) (( end.blue - start.blue ) / 7); lut_index = 0; for (i=0; i<8; i++) for (j=0; j<8; j++) for (k=0; k<8; k++) { if ( i == 0 || jump.red < 1 ) lut [ lut_index ].red = start.red; else lut [ lut_index ].red = jump.red * i - 1; if ( j == 0 || jump.green < 1 ) lut [ lut_index ].green = start.green; else lut [ lut_index ].green = jump.green * j - 1; if ( k == 0 || jump.blue < 1 ) lut [ lut_index ].blue = start.blue; else lut [ lut_index ].blue = jump.blue* k - 1; hardwarecolor.red = (short) lut [ lut_index ].red; hardwarecolor.green = (short) lut [ lut_index ].green; hardwarecolor.blue = (short) lut [ lut_index ].blue; hardwarecolor.pixel = lut_index; printf("HW1: i = %d : %d %d %d: pixel = %d \n", lut_index, hardwarecolor.red, hardwarecolor.green, hardwarecolor.blue, hardwarecolor.pixel ); status = XAllocColor ( dpy, colormap, &hardwarecolor ); printf("HW2: i = %d: %d %d %d: pixel = %d \n", lut_index, hardwarecolor.red, hardwarecolor.green, hardwarecolor.blue, hardwarecolor.pixel ); if ( status != 0 ) { XSetForeground ( dpy, gc, hardwarecolor.pixel ); XFillRectangle ( dpy, win, gc, 1, 1, MAXCOLUMN, MAXROW ); XFlush ( dpy ); sleep (10); printf("%d: %f %f %f at %d \n", lut_index, lut [ lut_index ].re lut [ lut_index ].green, lut [ lut_index ].blue, hardwarecolor.pixel ); } lut_index = lut_index + 1; } Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me with this problem.

372	From: Wilfred.Hansen@cs.cmu.EDU Subject: AIX3.2 version of Andrew 5.1 Organization: Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA Lines: 97 NNTP-Posting-Host: enterpoop.mit.edu To: xannounce@expo.lcs.mit.edu The Andrew Consortium of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon is pleased to announce AUIS 5.1.1 for AIX3.2 4/26/93 The Andrew User Interface System version 5.1 (our CDrom version) was developed for AIX version 3.1 on the IBM RS/6000 and many other platforms. To accomodate AIX version 3.2, we have created a patch to the sources. The patch and accompanying instructions for its application can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the internet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory ./aixpatch. For those without internet access, a 3.5" diskette can be ordered for $10 by sending, or faxing, a purchase order to the address below. The base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from the same host. Note that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows AUIS to compile under AIX3.2. ----------- The Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environment on top of X11 windows in which you can create, use, and mail multi-media applications and documents. A major advantage of AUIS is the capability to recursively embed objects. Thus, one can edit text that not only contains multiple fonts, indentation, and other typography, but also contains embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors, equations, simple animations, and so on. These embedded objects can themselves contain other objects, including text. AUIS has three components: The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set of applications beginning with the ez text editor, a help system, a system monitoring tool, an editor-based shell interface, and other editors corresponding to the various available types of objects. The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable, object-oriented user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein objects can be embedded in one-another. With the toolkit, programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as easily as those that come with the system. The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface to mail and bulletin-boards. AMS supports several mail management strategies and implements many advanced features including authentication, return receipts, automatic sorting of mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures, audit trails of related messages, and subscription management. It also provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and low-function personal computers in addition to high-function workstations. The current public release of Andrew, Version 5.1, includes support for the new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards for multipart, multimedia mail. A newer release, 5.2, for members of the Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new editors for drawings, images, fonts, and user preferences. Remote Andrew Demo Service You can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew Demo Service. You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11 window system. You'll be able to compose multimedia documents, navigate through the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the Andrew Message System to browse through a few of CMU's four thousand bulletin boards and newsgroups. To get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the following command on your machine: finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu The service will give you further instructions.

A number of the solutions provided through discussions here have been incorporated in the code, so have a look! The full blurb has been posted to comp.windows.x.announce. This post is in two parts. To unpack the source code, extract the articles into file1 and file2 (for example). Use a text editor to remove leading and trailing text at the "---cut here---" markers (including the markers themselves). Next type "cat file1 file2 > file", then "uudecode file" and "zcat xrastool1.0.tar.Z | tar xvf -". Read the README file for instructions on how to proceed from there. Enjoy! Derek P.S. The source is also available for anon ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib/ directory. If there is enough demand, a static binary will be provided for those without the XView libraries or include files. ----------------------------------------------------------- | Derek C.

That is, you have to rig up a timer queue, and you have to put a select(2) or poll(2) call in your main loop. You can obtain the file descriptor of the X display connection using fd = ConnectionNumber (display); The functionality of the main loop dispatcher in Xt is quite useful. The good news is, you can get the source and plagiarize!	4

386	From: morris@sg25.npt.nuwc.navy.MIL (morris hirsch) Subject: (none) Organization: The Internet Lines: 30 NNTP-Posting-Host: enterpoop.mit.edu We are adding a Motif wrapper to a family of data display programs. These programs are each written as a 'main loop' with these steps: - use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data otherwise block (new data comes quite often) - use msgop to check for messages and if true read them otherwise continue (messages are user commands and not often) - update the display according to latest data and messages. We typically have several of these running in windows, plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag. Everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run. Xt and Xm also have a 'main loop' model that we must fit into. O'Reilly Vol IV Ch 9 discusses adding a file-watcher and also how to add workprocs that are run during idle time. We can 'open-up' our existing main loop and call it as a workproc. The problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate. Neither is letting the program free-run because others are hurt. The unix select call lets you block until any of several i/o are ready. We want that for the X main loop except not file i/o. Any suggestions or examples most welcome! We run SGI Personal Iris and Indigo systems. Morris Hirsch aka morris@sg25.nusc.navy.mil or 401 841 7800	4
