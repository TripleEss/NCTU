There was at least one blast consistent with petroleum products that I saw, however propane is interesting stuff. It doesn't explode on contact with air. It is *possible* for a tank to rupture without exploding. Far more likely, however, is that the compound was equipped with NG outlets running to the tank. Damage from the CEV's could have ruptured the gas lines, allowing the gas to spread, unnoticed in the CS fumes and general excitement (propane typically has a distinctive odor added to it for just this reason -- to smell leaks), until reaching a flame or spark, and then Whooosh! Fire everywhere, and maybe an explosion. Use of NG is pretty common in Texas, especially semi-rural areas. > Further, the BD members have as much reason to lie as the > Gov't.

I would, reviewing other cases I've seen reported on in the articles I've read etc.., suggest the safest legal course of action is as follows. Warn your assailant loudly and in clear tones that you have a weapon(Yes!Even though it's blatantly obvious now that you have it out!) and that you will shoot him if he advances/does not cease whatever hostile action he is currently involved in.( ie: Drop the knife or I'll shoot!) Repeat this process three times,if you can!(not if he's pointing a freaking gun at you himself!That's kinda impractical.) (There are variables here and I will try to address them in turn) After said warning (considering it's ignored) Aim center mass and fire until he drops! This is not sadism, it's practicality.If he hasn't gone down he's still a threat!(Why I support .45) IF HE TURNS AND RUNS DO NOT PURSUE OR FIRE AT HIS BACK! SHOT'S FIRED IN ANGER WILL BURN YOU LATER! (Though in some cases the I can see where that might not bother me all that much!) If you do drop him! REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE! Have a Bystander or witness(Or Create one by yelling at the top of your lungs!) call the police, and wait! Reholster your weapon VISIBLY! Or place it on the ground nearby. Do not attempt to recollect your brass.The police will use it's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony and that of any witnesses. Mentally mark witnesses! If the police say that none came forward let them know who you saw! Attempt to keep your weapon loaded with the minimum required(how the hell can I phrase this?) Try to avoid special purpose ammunition. Hollow points and Hydrashock rounds give the opposing lawyer the type of loaded phrasing he will need to sawy the jury that you fully intended to kill someone! The only special purpose rounds that I can think of that would actually help your case (as it has in several) is the Glaser Safety Slug (oh what a lovely name SAFETY SLUG) The stated purpose and stated design parameters of the round are life savers in court. (ie. Attempting to create a bullet which will not overpenetrate, not ricochette, and which is designed to STOP (Not Kill (Gee, to bad the two often cross, damn I'm real sorry that rapist is dead! NOT!) an assailant with one shot. This, again, can be a real life saver in a hostile court. Be as cooperative with the police as possible! Show them where you were. Repeat your information as often as requested. They will often ask you the same questions over and over to verify facts, and ,unfortunately, to see if your lying. Fill out all statements and show all required identification and weapon permits (BOOO! Down with registered citizens!Register your politicians as deadly tax weapons needing to be confiscated!) If they are required in your state. Contact a lawyer immediately if they decide to hold you or that further questioning is needed. If you cannot afford one, contact the NRA.

Neil Smith Nntp-Posting-Host: blanca.lance.colostate.edu Organization: Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523 Lines: 108 Posted for L. Neil Smith by Cathy Smith THE LIES OF TEXAS Okay, what have we learned? For reasons still being kept secret, a federal agency already known -- well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative committees over the years -- for a longstanding, violent disregard of the law, invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and personal habits they abominate, violating his rights under the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. The man and his followers fight back, killing four of the outlaw agency's minions, wounding many more, and suffering their own losses in the process. The agency responds by cutting off his electricity, water, and especially his contact with the outside world. They are then free to say anything at all about him -- in pronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency finds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit eager to gain credit for "straightening out the mess" -- and, more importantly, to script his side of the subsequent "negotiations" any way they please. The impasse lasts almost two months, ironically, at the same time four L.A. cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a single individual, sparking one of the ugliest riots in history. Armored vehicles surround the house, already ringed with snipers using scoped, high-powered rifles. Loudspeakers playing obnoxious records at the highest possible volume, and searchlights, deprive those in the house of sleep (in the aftermath, nobody in authority will mention the effect this technique, originated by North Korean Communists as a battle tactic, may have had on their judgment). Finally -- another irony -- on the 50th anniversary of the rising of the Warsaw Ghetto, some of the armor punches holes in the house and gas of some kind is injected. The house bursts into flame and is reduced to ashes in less than an hour. At least 80 lives, including those of more than a dozen children, are snuffed out. Spokesmen for the outlaw agencies, the Attorney General, and the President all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme: blame the victim. He had illegal weapons -- as soon as they can be prepared in a secret government workshop and planted among the cinders being "examined" by the agency that created them. He was abusing children -- the tapes will be stored with the data on the JFK assassination. He set the fire -- our snipers saw him doing it. Film at 11 -- in 3000 A.D. He shot his followers who tried to escape -- or was that Jim Jones? Best of all, he's dead -- he can't say a damn thing to embarrass us, any more than when his contact with the world was severed at the start of the whole travesty. A leading national paper claims 93% of the American people believe that a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow responsible for everything that resulted. But when did you ever know 93% of Americans to agree on anything -- doesn't this sound more like the outcome of a Soviet election than an opinion poll? Very well, what can we infer from the above? For starters, never forget that, although Democratic careers are on the line (and rightfully so) over this fiasco, by the outlaw agency's admission, it was planned and rehearsed by a Republican administration. Which may explain why Paul Harvey, who evidently used up all his courage and integrity changing his mind (at about the same time I did) about the war in Viet Nam -- has been acting as little more than a mouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the Bill of Rights. More importantly, when Rush Limbaugh, who's been a quivering tower of Jello during the whole thing, takes essentially the same stance as Bill Clinton, it's time for fundamental changes, if not in the system, then at least within yourself. On March 5, back at the beginning, Mary Gingell, national chair of the Libertarian Party, issued a press release condemning the outlaw agency and calling for its abolition. In fact, the LP has promised in its platform since 1977, for at least 16 years, to abolish both agencies involved in Waco. I'm proud to say I was there and helped to write that plank. True, the LP is tiny and insignificant (although less so than in 1977 -- ask the Democrats in Georgia if you doubt it). But, alone in a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their behinds with phony polls and Big Lies, the LP is right about what happened in Waco. And if their advice had been followed in 1977, Waco never would have happened. Think about it. And think about the fact that, if you've had enough of political parties more interested in collecting and holding power -- at whatever cost to the Bill of Rights, let alone human life -- than in defending and expanding individual liberty, maybe the change it's time for within yourself is to make the LP less tiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote.

THIS COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN. Maybe they get the wrong address and then raid *your* home, for example. It's happened before and it can happen *again*. I have heard of more than one instance of a no-knock raid going sour. Just recently I heard about a case in which police raided this guy's home because they thought he had dope or something. The guy blew both of the officers away and he didn't go to jail for it. The judge hearing the case ruled that the man was acting in self-defense. > With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with > mega fire power.

Then - BOOM - the fireball. After that explosion and concussion, I doubt anybody on the inside of the building was capable of moving. : And besides... oh, I don't know why I'm even bothering. Good question. Take an objective look at what happened, listen to the things that the FBI said ("The BD's started the fire."

Oddly enough, their budget was about to be reviewed just two weeks after the initial raid on the BD's. "Coincidence? I think not!" And as for the fire, what happened was caused by the act of knocking over walls with an armored vehicle of destruction. The FBI tried to convince the world it was suicide, but all of the facts that are coming out by the investigation of the Texas rangers and medical examiners point to a gas explosion and quick fire that decimated all of the occupants of the building.

A rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths, and not attempt to affect childhood falls, drownings, gunshot injuries, etc.???????????????? So this so called rational person, (using your definition), if he or she were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged 25 through 64 would only worry about cancer, and would not try to decrease LESSER CAUSES such as heart disease, injuries, stroke, suicide, liver disease, chronic lung disease, homicide, HIV infection, or diabetes. Oh, okay Charles, that makes a lot of sense. I tell you what Charles, I'll call the Heart Foundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational and that they can all go home because they are addressing the LESSER CAUSES of death. And you call your local police homicide department, liver foundation and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes. Please, quit wasting my time with this silly shit Charles. I've got an idea Charles, why don't you start a talk.politics.caraccidents group or talk.politics.fall group? This is talk.politics.guns.

But if you insist, according to the 1990 UCR, "Firearm murders of youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990" Is the National Center for Health Statistics good enough for you? They state that "Every day, 12 American children ages 19 and under are killed in gun accidents, suicides, and homicides. Many more are wounded". Or how about the National Pediatric Trauma Registry? They say "Gunshot wounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas between 1987 and 1990." Do you also doubt the American Academy of Pediatrics Charles??? They state that "Gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300% from 1986 to 1988." Charles, I hope you don't need to be convinced that youth are increasingly victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns. If you don't realize this fact, (I don't care if you go by CDC or FBI data, or if you go into the homes, schools, and streets where these kids are and take a poll by yourself), I'm not going to bother to try to convince you.

As a physicist, I realize that you probably don't come into contact with many youth, but I REALLY think you need to make a trip to your local urban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools. In addition spend a few minutes talking to these kids. Ask them if they have ever heard gunshots in their neighborhoods, whether they know anyone who has been shot, whether they know anyone who has a gun, whether they have ever held a gun, and whether they themselves have ever been shot.

Ideally, these questions could be asked at any investigation into the BATF's and FBI's participation at the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth from the BATF and FBI. My list is up to 13 that are really nagging at my gut. The list will probably grow. 1. What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that the BATF obtained? 2. It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition could not be flushed down the toilet. Therefore, a "no-knock" raid could be ruled out. Prior to the initial assault on the complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock on the door of the Branch Davidian's complex and serve the warrant in a manner prescribed by law? 3. On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents were aware that several small children were inside the buildings. In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child. Knowing children were present, why didn't the BATF have an alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? 4. The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over $200,000 in firearms and ammunition. Did David Koresh and the members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms License, were they actively participating in the legal business of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the weapons they had illegally possessed? Does this paper evidence consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally dispossessed weapons. 5. After the original assault on the compound tragically failed, a BATF spokeswoman stated "We were outgunned!". Yet, TV newscasts of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles. Although unclear on the video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles. What type(s) of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the scene of the original assault on the complex? 6. Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a "hostage" situation? 7. Along the same lines, why did the FBI use "psychological warfare" techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind? 8. Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex were accompanied by their mothers. Since it is reasonable to expect these mothers would have their children taken away from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities? 9. Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch Davidians setting fire to the complex. Branch Davidian members who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a lantern which was setting on a table. Video tape of the incident does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location. Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle penetrated? 10. FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide. Yet, bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas within the building complex. This seems to be counter to any known mass suicides through history. What evidence does the FBI have that a mass suicide pact existed? 11. FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian's ammunition and/or powder cache exploding. Yet, the fireball seems to be more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas or other highly volatile fuel source explodes. Was any evidence found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball? If so, and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect for someone engaged in such a legal business? 12. It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound. Is there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act? 13. FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the complex, "over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles." On the video tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles engines. Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one would expect to hear if shots were fired. Also, there are no indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows, buildings or other structures in the video. Surely, these should be evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles. Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter, sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles. Do any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by shots from high-power rifles? 14. CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent. The United States has signed international treaties which prevent the use of CS gas in warfare. If the United States could not morally use CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land? 15. On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had been murdered or had committed suicide. On April 22, the county coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet wounds to the head. Were any of the victims bodies found within the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head? -- ************************************************************** * Ron Phillips crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com * * Senior Customer Engineer * * Intergraph Electronics * * 381 East Evelyn Avenue VOICE: (415) 691-6473 * * Mountain View, CA 94041 FAX: (415) 691-0350 * **************************************************************	0

It was explained that two news photographers were found on the compound earlier this morning without permission. It was explained to the press corps. that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer turning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous by a Texas Ranger surveying the site. (!) The two photographers were said to be currently in jail and the press were warned to follow the authorities' guidelines. It was also emphasized that the survey of the "crime" scene at this point was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere. The press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the site has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case. That is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my memory. I bring this up because I haven't seen anyone else note it and I haven't seen the regular newscasts mention it. It will probably be mentioned in the papers tomorrow. My opinions: ----------- I find this disturbing. While I believe that Koresh is largely responsible for not ending this standoff in a peacable manner during the last 51 days of patient opportunity, I find the secrecy surrounding the aftermath more damaging to the authorities' position than they realize. Since the vast majority of potential defendents in a court case are already dead, the emphasis on the importance of building the court case seems overblown to me. It will be interesting to see the hearings on this affair. I have also heard congressional calls for a review and possible overhaul of government enforcement agencies which you will recall I have stated would be a good idea in previous months. Please also note that I by no means endorse or agree with the many conspiracy-type theories I have read here and in other groups. As usual, I am basing my opinions on info gathered from various media and filtered by my own common sense and consideration of plausibility, IMHO. As such, my opinion is subject to change as more information is made available. Scott Roby Standard Disclaimer --	0

I noticed that too. Special agent (asshole actually) Ricks stated that David Koresh had "explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40 feet into the air." It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of opportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in the first place. For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas into the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren't living in a fortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because it was idling there for a considerable length of time. So, why didn't they do this? Could it be that they didn't have any explosives or similar munitions? I just don't buy what the ATF and FBI have been saying. Hopefully, the truth will come out. Here's something noteworthy: after the fire had been burning for some time an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion. The media said that this was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off. I don't think this was the case. My brother and I noticed that this so-called "explosion" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited. We figure that this is what it was because of how the "explosion" looked and sounded. Obviously, it wasn't due to something like TNT, dynamite, or C4. I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion in the ranch house greatly resembled this. Also, I noticed something that looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day. Isn't it curious that the ATF wasn't very forthcoming about how the four officers got killed? Many weeks had gone by before they stated that some of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown by the BDs. Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about whether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they said that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN'T READY TO RELEASE THE FINDINGS. Now why is this? Does the ATF have something to hide? Perhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire. What is the cause of death exactly? NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS. What is certain is this: ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the compound. As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade body during one of the lawyer's visits to the compound. Later on the lawyer gave the grenade body (I don't know if it was a dud or a spent one btw) to the ATF. How much do you want to bet that this grenade will mysteriously disappear? At this point in time the only people we know who had grenades was the ATF agents. Wouldn't it be a shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets, or explosives in the rubble? The ATF would sure have egg on their face then. Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the rubble. The FBI and the Texas Rangers won't investigate until the ATF is done. This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to make sure that others "find" what they want for them to "find" if you know what I mean. I'm probably being a little paranoid here but if I am I have could reason to be. Recall that several weeks had gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades. Also recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents used grenades on the BDs. Someone is lying here.

Keywords: Kates Lines: 110 This was posted by Lyn Bates to the firearms-politics mailing list: I recently learned that Don Kates was going to be in Boston to give a talk at the Harbard Law School about the Waco situation. (Of course, this was all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy conclusion.) So, yesterday I went to hear him. What follows is a rough summary of what I think I heard him say, which should not be taken as exactly what he actually said... Kates started by saying that since he didn't know any more about the fire than the audience did (it had just happened the day before), he would not discuss that, but would concentrate on the original raid. Koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck. But so what? This isn't the first time that the leader of a new, small religious group has been ridiculed by the public. Extreme religious views nearly always fuel hatred and mistrust. The first amendment applies, maybe especially, to people like Koresh. Lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the US. There were none until about 1830, when they began in metropolitan areas. Police originally were not armed; if they found a crime in progress, they called local armed citizens to help. Many began to carry arms for protection despite regulations against them, eventually the laws were changed to allow them to carry guns. The original intent was to have many small police departments, jealous of one another and competitive, but not large enough to be a threat to liberty, hence the plethora of organizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard. When the FBI was started, agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (they were to be, after all, a bureau of investigation, not a police force). "All police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that power." The BATF started as a tax collection agency, whose primary job was to raid illegal stills. When the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners no longer found their trade no longer profitable, many illegal stills disappeared, and the BATF needed something else to do to justify its existence, so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores. Around the time when the BATF's annual budget is under review, the media is alerted by the BATF to come to such-and-such a place, where at a pre-arranged time, a bunch of cars full of BATF agents roar up to the door and the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a gun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly. The media isn't invited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork, but if any irregularities are found, the media gets to cover the agents removing armfuls of guns from the premises, and the luckless FFL in chains. The Waco incident happened a few weeks before BATF's budget was up for review. Kates' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad, and that the BATF never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot at, or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100 agents over open ground with no cover, for example), and would have had some medical personnel on hand. He confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for Koresh's arrest in connection with a murder charge, and the local sheriff called him on the phone and explained about it. Koresh sais, ok, come pick me up, and the sheriff did, temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could be tested. Koresh was later cleared, release, and presumably got his guns back. At least at that time, he was rational enough to be approached rationally, and behaved in a reasonable manner. The BATF didn't take into account that, unlike most of the FFL's they audit, Koresh was actually paranoid, and fostered paranoia in his followers. Thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them, and they reacted accordingly. With respect to the original warrant, it had not been unsealed when Kates was giving his talk, so he could not comment on it, except to mention that the BATF has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their informants, if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant. He had more to say about the way the warrant was served, which may have been completely illegal. Apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to knock on the door and announce that you're an officer with a warrant for thus-and-so; if they don't open the door and the evidence is flushable, then it is ok to break in the door. But since it is hard to flush guns down the toilet, there may have been no justification for the BATF breaking in the way they did. If the constitutional rights of the Davidians were violated by an invalid warrant, or by an improperly served warrant, then the Davidians may have been justified in their actons. A close look at one of the original films shows that one BATF agent _may_ have shot himself by accident when entering the building; if so, this was the first shot fired! The role of the media could have been a whole lot worse. After an initial position on the side of the BATF, the media began to come around to the view that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held off a bad, possibly illegal attack. A real cynic might say that the FBI went in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was beginning to change sides, and the FBI wanted to act before they lost the public's sympathy. Should the BATF be abolished? No. Police agencies _should_ be numerous, diverse, inefficient, decentralized, etc. Better a few inept accidents like this, than a move toward a single, large, well-organized, well-trained, powerful, domestic police force, which would eventually have even more tragic results. - Lyn Bates (bates@bbn.com) PS Don Kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at Boston College Law School next Tuesday, April 27. I don't know the exact time or place, but presumably a phone call to the BC law school could elicit that information. -- Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com	0

I'm just getting started with this type of activity, so please set your flame-thowers on low. Comments, corrections, suggestions, welcomed. **************************************************************************** Editor, I would like to ask you and your readers a few questions that are related to the "right to keep and bear arms", and to a greater degree, the many other "rights" that we take for granted on a daily basis. 1. You're sleeping at night, when you hear someone in your house. You call the police. How will you defend yourself, should the need arise, while you are waiting for the police to arive? 2. You are driving your family home when your car breaks down. A "good samaritan" stops to "help", when you find you and your family at gun-point or knife-point. How will you defend yourself? And your Family? 3. You are a woman walking alone to your car or home. A man appears suddenly with the intent to rape you. How will you defend yourself? Are you strong enough to fight off your attacker? Are you willing to let this man rape you in order to survive the attack? If the House and Senate have their way, we will soon not have the right to keep and bear arms, as provided by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. A gun may not be the answer to each and every dangerous situation, but are you going to let the politicians decide what sort of force or weapon you may use to defend yourself and your family? Many times a situation may be diffused by just brandishing your handgun. If certain members of the House and Senate have their way, .25, .32, and 9mm ammunition will be banned for sale to anyone other than the military and law enforcement departments. Very soon, you may not be able to purchase ammunition for use in your handgun. There is already a 15 day waiting period in California. Do you really feel that any law abiding citizen should be required to wait this amount of time for the purchase of a handgun when his life or family members have been threatened? Our local police do an excellent job, but they can not be there all the time, or in a moments notice. You should have the right to protect yourself while waiting for help to arrive. There is currently legislation circulating in Washington that would prohibit the sale of certain types of ammuntion, handguns, rifles, and shot-guns. One elected official even wants to repeal the Second Amendment! I want to ask the readers of this paper what they would do if their elected officials decided that they should only belong to a "certain church", or go to church on a "partiular day"? What if you were told that you could only read certain books? Write about certain subjects? What if you no longer had the right to a jury of your peers? How about the right to assemble in a peaceful manner? These are all rights that are provided by our Constitution and the Amendments. If we give up one right, we may as well give them all up. If you do not fight for the right to keep and bear arms, what will you fight for? When your life is affected? Write your law makers now! Protect all of your rights by defending your Second Amendment rights.	0

I don't understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is important. So guns don't kill as many children as car accidents. What is the difference in severity between 1,000 deaths and 10,000 deaths? I am not trying to use accidental gun-related deaths among children as a justification for gun control. Who needs to be convinced that accidental gun deaths of children is a serious problem?

If YOU look carefully you will see that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths. The CPHV reports that 135,000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that 400,000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year. The CDC estimates that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once in 1990. The CDC also says that 1.2 million elementary-aged, latch-key children (kids who come home from school to an empty house), have access to guns in their home. California schools reported a 200% increase in student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990, and a 40% increase between 1988 and 1990. Florida reported a 61% percent increase in gun incidents in schools between 1986/87 amd 1987/88.

The temperature in the room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catches fire at once. This may have occurred in the BD compound, I have heard reports that the windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticed by those outside the compound. When the fire got big enough, and broke through the walls, it appeared to be started in two places but was really one big fire. Because of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the building it is possible that many of the women and children were in a room free of tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas. When they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for them to escape. They were trapped by the flames in their safe room. I find it hard to believe that the FBI was not recording the final assault. I think that they would have wanted to have tapes to show their agents of the the FBI overcoming the "forces of evil", aka the Branch Davidians. The tapes would also allow the FBI to prove that they were not using excessive force. -- Rod Anderson N0NZO | The only acceptable substitute Boulder, CO | for brains is silence. rcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu | -Solomon Short- satellite N0NZO on ao-16 |	0

If we are indeed talking about CS, then this is not quite accurate. CS is "just" tear gas--albeit the worst kind. It isn't a nausea gas, and doesn't have direct CNS effects. However, it's quite bad--much worse than CN gas. I was briefly exposed to it once (during an engagement in Berkeley circa 1968 8^) and it's not the kind of thing you forget. It seems to be moisture-activated--it not only made my eyes sting and water, but attacked my breathing passages and lungs. Breathing was painful, and my entire face felt as if it was on fire. These effects persisted for hours after exposure, and I was coughing for days afterwards. If I was exposed to a dense concentration of this stuff in a closed space for several hours, I doubt whether I could find the exit. Indeed, I can't imagine living through it. -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ | Die Welt ist alles, was Zerfall ist. | Peter Cash | (apologies to Ludwig Wittgenstein) |cash@convex.com ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	0

And you've just described any civilian reactor because your definition fails to note what energy is being considered. Reactors blow with a steam explosion, but the majority of energy still comes from fission or fusion because that is what heated the coolant. See what a can of worms this is? Last I heard, Ft. Calhoun station just north of Omaha, Nebraska wasn't considered a weapon. Given the sodium-cooled breeder designs on the blocks now, I can easily envision reactors being household appliances in under twenty years. With the PRISM design, there is *no* operator input needed on the reactor itself, and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can be made equally as automatic in the future. So your definition is flawed in a few respects already. > Let's define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses >in such state, quantity, and with such a vector that they could cause >death or serious disease [further defined] to a significant number of >people if released in a city, similarly populated area, resevoir, or >cropland. Typhoid Mary would likely fit this bill if she sneezed. If you don't mind extrapolation, any HIV-positive person also fits this bill if they interact with others in a way that stands any chance of spreading the virus. Finally, that manure pile I mention below fits this definition, as does, say, releasing a pet rattlesnake to the wild. >Nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined. Other poisonous >gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there >is no use not related to weaponry. Licenses should be available for >research purposes on such chemicals. And I can show where any such gas has other uses. For example, perhaps we would like to rid the hay field of gophers. Calcium Carbide is a rock that dissolves in water to produce aceteylne gas. It can be used for welding, in miners lamps, for gassing gophers, or for making carbide bombs and doing some illicit fishing. Toss some in a toilet and leave a lighted cigarette on the seat and you'll see that it can also be a weapon, just like any other flammable substance. So, now my miners lamps won't work, I can't do any welding, and I still have those pesky gophers. >I am not a lawyer, but these ideas could certainly be a basis for >definitions. The basis for, but I'm sure you see that the problem is not in writing a law, it is in writing a law that cannot be abused and extended beyond the point where it does any good. >>I'll give >>you a little hint: see that manure pile in the farmer's field down the >>road?

It is an instrument that can be used for fighting, even though that is not its intended purpose, and despite there being better weapons around. Given that the aquifers supply a significant part of the country with drinking water, mass destruction is rather a given. It's not that certain weapons aren't something I'd rather not see a lot of people having. The problem is that it is nearly impossible to write a law such that it cannot be abused upon some pretext or another. The looser your definition, the more ripe for abuse that law is. Furthermore, if you get specific then the old standby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to be added to, generally without going through the hassles of another vote and public reading of the law. Again, ripe for abuse. < Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu > < ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

Personally, if the fire was set (by either side), I wonder about the timing. If Koresh & Co. set the fires, why wait through six hours of wall-bashing and tear-gassing before starting; was there anything "new" that happened just around that point? Similarly, if the FBI were going to torch the place (and fake it, of course), why wait so long, wouldn't it be more "reasonable" to believe the BD's would set the fire early after the assault began? The most plausible (to me) explaination is that of an accidental starting of the fire by the tanks. Among other things, I say that because I was listening to the radio when the fire started and the reporter (watching from a distance, of course) said that it looked like at least one of the tanks had penetrated farther into the building than previously. Specifically, he said that one tank apparently was halfway (half of the tank's lenght) into the building where it previously had only been penetrating a few feet. reserving judgement, -Aaron	0

But they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the ATF to care for their wounded. The BD even released the ATF agents they captured. It is clear from the release of the agents and allowing the ATF medical attention that the BD were not looking for trouble. If the BD were violent they would have held the ATF agents as hostages. They would not have released them like they did. If they had kept the agents hostage they could have used them as bargening chips for medical attention etc. A big thing is being made of the BD collection of weapons but no one has shown that they had any plans to use them. It is also apparent that the BD did not have any military training. If they had, they could have dug bunkers and trenches and increased their fortifications. They could have shot out the lights and speakers. It appears that the BD were not violent, they shot back at the attacking ATF agents out of panic. There were shots fired on the last day but they were in response to the FBI attack on the compound with armor.

Yes, its a horrible way to go, but apparently not so horrible that someone with enough religious conviction might not be able to carry it through.

But clearly It was a "no-knock", according to the Associated Press report. Here's something I found in my collection: Excerpts from an article in the Knoxville News-Sentinel Final Edition Monday, March 1, 1993 (the byline is associated press): WACO, Texas - Fierce gun battles erupted Sunday as more than 100 law officers tried to arrest the leader of a heavily armed religious cult. At least four federal agents and two cult members were reported killed. [...] The gun battles began when federal agents hidden in livestock trailers stormed the sect's head-quarters Sunday morning, ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ witnesses said. The agents had warrants to search for guns and explosives and to arrest Howell, said Les Stanford of the ATF in Washington. [...] Witnesses said the law officers stormed the compound's main home, throwing concussion grenades and screaming "Come out," while three ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ National Guard helicopters approached. For a moment, there was no response. Then the shooting began. I think "storming the sect's head-quaters" and "throwing concussion grenades" qualifies as a no-knock (or perhaps an illegal assault). > he was not just another guy minding his own business.

The BATF is a part of the dept. of treasury, not justice. If they needed to assault a place they could just do like the IRS does...call in the federal marshalls service, their fugitive collection teams do similar type assaults all the time. And they are very, very good about it, in both the tactical and legal parts of it. But I suspect that the marshalls would not have touched it, because the search warrant (which is still sealed I believe) was so bogus. Besides the BATF also could have gotton SWAT teams from: federal marshalls service; FBI; secret service; national park service; texas rangers; nearby large city police forces; the military. But they had to use their own guys, nobody elses SWAT team was good enough for the holy cause of gun control. I also find the timing of the raid to be extremely interesting. Initial raid: two days before the NJ senate was going to overturn their "assault weapon" confiscation law; a couple weeks before the BATF's budget was going to come up in congress for review; shortly after Reno got confirmed as AG (I don't need to remind you about her anti-gun line); right around the presidents 100th day in office.

The number bounces between 2% and 18%, depending on the study quoted and the type of gun being studied. Some cites: --------------------------------------- A recent BATF study (titled "Protecting America, Yes") surveyed 471 career criminals and found that only 7% of guns used in violent crimes were purchased from retail dealers. --------------------------------------- National Institute of Justice Research in Brief November 1986 The Armed Criminal in America by James D. Wright (1) Legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct sources of handguns for adult felony offenders. Only about one-sixth of the gun-owning felons obtained their most recent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a licensed firearms dealer. The remainder -- five out of six -- obtained them via informal, off-the-record transactions involving friends and associates, family members, and various black market outlets. The means of acquisition from these informal sources included cash purchase, swaps and trades, borrowing and renting, and often theft. The criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominated by informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply. --------------------------------------- INDEPENDENCE ISSUE PAPER No. 4- 91 Independence Institute 14142 Denver West Parkway #101 Golden, CO 80401 (303) 279-6536 WHY GUN WAITING PERIODS THREATEN PUBLIC SAFETY By David B. Kopel The basic problem with waiting periods is shown by a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms study of gun dealer sales in Des Moines and Greenville. The study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous criminals.[51] In short, waiting periods have no statistically noticeable impact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime guns are purchased at retail by ineligible buyers. 51. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Assistant Director of Criminal Enforcement, Memorandum to Director, July 10, 1975 (Greenville survey; of 20,047 names submitted to FBI for record checks, 68 had felony convictions; of those, 41 had not been represented by counsel at their conviction or who committed crimes in the distant past; twenty-seven buyers were prosecuted) (of the 1.3% of buyers selected for prosecution, .9% had non-violent felony convictions, and .4% had violent convictions). Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Assistant Director for Criminal Enforcement, memorandum to Director, May 8, 1975 (of 374 records checked, 39 were purchasers with felony records who were not appropriate for prosecution because of age or non-violent nature of felony; six purchasers were prosecuted). --------------------------------------- INDEPENDENCE ISSUE PAPER No. 12-91 THE ASSAULT WEAPON PANIC: POLITICAL CORRECTNESS" TAKES AIM AT THE CONSTITUTION By Eric Morgan and David Kopel Testimony before Congress revealed that most "assault weapons" in the hands of criminals were obtained through illegal channels.{97} The testimony is consistent with the National Institute of Justice's research findings based on studies of felons in state prisons. The NU study, authored by sociologists James D. Wright and Peter Rossi found that only sixteen percent of criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store. (The figures included purchases by legal surrogates, rather than directly by the criminal.) Wright and Rossi, who had begun their research as firm proponents of gun control, concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases, and probably not even full scale gun prohibition, would reduce criminal use of guns. Wright and Rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime directly target the black market in criminal guns, and leave the legitimate retail market alone.{98} Not surprisingly, Wright believes that the consequences of current "assault weapon" legislation on street violence are likely to be ineffective.{99} He warns that gun controls aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of criminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new business.{100} 6. _See, _e.g., The Anti-drug, Assault Weapons Limitation Act of 1989.

So far, the medical examiner (according to the news) has found NO EVIDENCE of gunshot wounds in bodies so far examined. If this continues to be the case, it will sort of shoot holes (pun intended) in the FBI story, wouldn't it? And cartridges going off outside a firearm do not launch a bullet like they do when fired from a gun. The bullet hardly moves, it is the brass casing that goes flying, and then with less than lethal force. It will hurt, yes, but not KILL you - I doubt if it wil penetrate a coat, for example. How about an INDEPENDENT investigation, with full subpoena powers, and powers to prosecute on felony charges, to investigate for any possible illegal/criminal activity on the part of both the BATF and FBI?

Twist. CrimeStrike is working to reverse the disturbing trend of daily crime. It is promoting solutions that can be applied nationally, including tough and honest sentencing of the sort that Arizona is applying with its Truth in Sentencing law; funding construction and staffing of appropriate prison space; ensuring that the system is primed to punish serious youthful offenders; strict attention to the rights of victims; and citizen and community involvement. Phoenix will be the home for this national organization. The Gazette has vigorously opposed many NRA policies on issues of gun control, and will be resolute in promoting prudent laws that seek reasonable regulation of firearms. But CrimeStrike is an appropriate creation, a response to a clear need for more robust vigilance in holding legislators and judges ac- countable when it comes to swiftly and surely punishing criminals. When an organization has an issue, it has an issue, and Crime- Strike has it - especially when it is willing to direct its dollars to getting criminals off the street. We say, welcome to town.	0

I believe that this is not quite correct. My understanding is that LDS is engaged on a project to "convert" the souls of deceased persons of other religions, in order to spare them from damnation and gain them entrance into heaven. To this end, the Church has compiled extensive genaeological records, so that they will know the names of people to convert. A long article in the New Yorker a few years ago described the LDS research methods in some detail (for example, some researchers pay visits to local native storytellers to learn the names of people long dead). This sounds like just the sort of lie that would be made up about any unusual religion, but the New Yorker story convinced me that there is some truth to it (the New Yorker used to do extensive fact-checking, and the story was quite detailed).

If the body had been denatured (cooked) or dehydrated due to the heat, a projectile needs only a minimal kinetic force to penetrate. In fire aftermaths, bodies tend to fall apart or loose large chunks of meat with little effort. Medical Examiners tend not to like cleaning up such scenes. As such, if the body had been suitably cooked, a bullet comming from a magazine explosion would more than likely have enough force to enter and thus it would be difficult to determine whether a bullet entered at the time of death, or much later, unless you were trained to look for the evidence.

And as far as "evidence", what are you talking about? Everything the Feds have said they've retracted practically as soon as they get questioned in detail about it.

Maybe they figured they'd just go in there and run roughshod over the BDs during their religious services (which was the reason the Feds gave for the timing of the raid) rather than running into resistance. Maybe they KNEW that the BDs weren't ANYWHERE NEAR as violent as the Feds' spin doctors are trying to tell the public. Maybe they were AFRAID to try this kind of thing on the Crips and Bloods. Maybe it was because the ATF's budget is up for approval and they seem to favor doing something dramatic whenever that is the case.

For those of you still unsure whether this is satire, the jury is still out: "Also yesterday, even though the compound no longer exists, the US attorney's office here released formerly sealed documents, including a search warrant and related affidavits, that authorities planned to use when the siege was over. "These documents did not include the original warrants the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms had in late February, which to this day have never been released. "...one of the documents indicated the agency planned to seek samples of Koresh's handwriting not only to verify that he had signed for some gun purchases, but also that he espoused 'certain doctrines hostile to law enforcement and particularly the ATF.'" So, one of the charges against Koresh seems to be Contempt of Cop -- he expressed hostility to the BATF.

You see that this individual has a submachinegun, and that more similarly armed individuals are rushing your front door. Will you a) defend yourself and family against this attack b) realize "oh, only the BATF would enter like that, so I better surrender" or c) roll over and let whoever is attacking your home do what they would like? You have chosen a), and discover that the people you defended yourself against are federal agents, who now are camped outside your door waiting for you to surrender. You have learned that they intend to charge you with murder, and are further defaming your name, while claiming that you can safely surrender at any time. Then they start using psychological warfare techniques against you, while still claiming that you can safely give up and will receive a fair trial. Some weeks into this standoff, you are still holding out, when they begin a new ploy to induce your surrender, namely using tear gas to annoy you, and ramming your home with tanks. Yet they claim that you can safely surrender at any time. While you patiently wait out this latest round of attacks, your house catches fire and the bales of hay you were using as cover spread the fire rapidly through the house, and you try to escape through the fortifications you had raised for your own defense and the rubble created by the tanks. Only 9 of your followers make it. I am not claiming that the above scenario is accurate. I am disagreeing with the notion that it is their own fault for dying because they refused to surrender to agents of the Federal government after another federal agency committed an armed assault of their home on the basis of a flimsily concocted search warrant. Look at how the Texas Rangers view the BATF. Look at the FBI statements regarding the BATF actions. From all apparent sources, the FBI blundered trying to clean up the mess made by the BATF, resulting in an accidental fire which killed most of the BD's who were still in the compound, and are now playing CYA. The BATF committed an illegal assault, obtained the use of Texas NG resources with fabricated allegations, and compounded their abuses by accusing the BD's of crimes outside their jurisdiction once they had been held off in their assault. -- ******************************************************************************** James S.

Roger Santaw Jr. also plead- ed guilty to an attempted escape from Cheshire County jail last win- ter. Santaw, 32 is scheduled to be sentenced next week. The rape last fall came six months after Santaw was released from prision, where he spent 15 years for a rape he commit- ted when he was 16. (AP) [end of article] Any reactions? Did he do enough time? What should his penalty be? BTW, Walpole is a town in Massachusetts. Of course, New hampshire is close by. J. Case Kim kim39@husc.harvard.edu	0

I suppose I didn't make myself clear, cause you seem to have gotten exactly the opposite impression from what I intended. I suppose "the authorities" might have been a better term than "society". Carry and use a firearm in many parts of the country (certainly the parts I live in), and expect, at the very least, to have an awful lot of explaining to do. And there is also appears to be a trend in society at large that actively opposes what many see as their right to defend themselves. In a few other parts of our society, handguns are banned or so restricted as to be practically unavailable to the law- abiding citizen for self-defense outside the home. Funny, though, how the criminals in such places continue to have a lush supply of guns and no compunctions about using them. IMHO, you don't need to be either a political philosopher or a crime victim to realize that there's a flaw in the gun- grabbers' logic. Agreed. You're welcome to your HO, too, the First Amendment being as important as the Second, but please don't let your obvious good intentions be subverted by insupportable generalities about something as big and diverse as US society. My only intention was to comment that the existence of suitable weapons of self defense doesn't mean you'll escape a whole shitload of trouble should you be forced to use them. Or by the naive hope that making gun possession a crime will give pause to someone who would be a criminal anyway. I made no such statements, nor do I have such a naive hope or outlook. Wishing you peace and the wherewithal to defend yourself if others' thoughts are not that kindly, That's all I want: the opportunity to leave in peace, or to have the means to defend myself when that in not possible.

At the time of the shooting, no rocks were being thrown at all. The squad was slowly proceeding up a knoll, away from the body of students. Some students were taunting them, and photographs of the incident show at most one or two students who were following and taunting. The series of photographs show the squad slowly proceeding up the hill, while occasionally their NCO, .45 in hand turned back to look at where they came from. All at once, as if on command, the entire squad turned and fired their M1 Garands, firing 30.06 rounds into the crowd (the NCO can be shown with this 45 at full recoil). At least two of the students shot had nothing to do with the taunters... they were only passing through, and were not participants in the confrontation. There is some dispute whether the Guard was even legally on Campus... apparently they had not been invited onto the state school by the president, who had conveniently flown the coop, so as not to be around. The governor of Ohio, James Rhodes, had just embarked on a senate campaign, and wanted it to be known that he was tough on peaceniks, so had ordered the guard in. The matter was quickly covered up. Some years later, wounded survivors launched a civil lawsuit against those responsible... a settlement was made, and under the terms, the plaintiffs could not discuss much, and guilty individuals were not identified (in fact, those shooters in the squad have been identified). It was a tragic incident, but it was not provoked by the students, or apparently by General DelCorso or any of his command. From studying the incident & the photos, IMO it looks like it was an independent action by a small squad of soldiers.	0

Get a life and chill on the paranoia. I am not a paranoid, nor a government toady, nor even am I the guy you were talking to originally, but I think you are simply NOT PAYING ATTENTION. A bunch of people living off by themselves with a lot of guns nearby is not that wierd in Texas. My own family, very quiet taxpayers with extremely con- ventional views, has something like 10 rifles and shotguns in a two-person home. Some of them were mine, but I don't live there anymore. I now have my own shotgun in my apartment. Texas Child Protective Services (which loves to find child abuse) found no, I repeat NO, evidence of abuse when they first looked at the BD, and is saying that they see none in any of the kids who were released. There is no evidence that Koresh was banging anyone but his wives. It is not against the law to stockpile (most) weapons or campbell's soup. Nor is there any hard evidence in the form of actual hardware (as I write this) to prove the BD really had any *proscribed* weapons. I feel they were all loonies, but there is no indication that they ever bothered anyone. They were gone after in the wrong ways for the wrong reasons, and the BATF and FBI who are so busy trumpeting this child abuse angle hasn't got a leg to stand on or any right to be involved in such abuse cases anyway. If there was any real danger of the BD's going out on a rampage, then that is up to the officers of the state of Texas, who are probably getting a per- verse bit of pleasure at getting to torque the Feds for fucking up something in their state. semper fi, Jammer Jim Miller Texas A&M University '89 and '91 ________________________________________________________________________________ I don't speak for UH, which is too bad, because they could use the help.

No one ultimately oversees the federal agencies you mention, and since Koresh "apparently" has a different view point from your Baptist upbringing, then he is not worthy of protection from religious persecution. As to being the Messiah, is not Christ within us all? Must be comforting to belong to a government approved religion.

The Administration has given no indication that such suspensions will occur in this case. And given that the president, attorney general and governor were all involved in the decisions that led to the Waco Massacre, they should also suspend all activities regarding law enforcement. Given their positions, that equates to an enforced vacation. -- REMEMBER WACO! Who will the government decide to murder next? Maybe you?

(This is also >covered in the above reference.) No more risk than smaller stashes unless the stash is somehow confined so the heat from early ignitions could somehow bulk-heat the remainder. Two years ago this month my house and office burned. In my office was my reloading bench. On the top shelf next to the wooden ceiling was about 100 lbs of smokeless powder, 5 lbs of black powder, several thousand primers and a couple thousand loaded rounds, primarily in .45ACP, .30-20 and .308. The fire was extinguished before the area containing the reloading supplies were fully involved. There was about 1/2" of char on the joists, subsequently removed by sandblasting. Lots of heat in other words. None of the powder kegs ignited. One 1lb can of pistol powder ignited. No explosion, as the can opened at the seam as it was designed to do. The black powder cans were charred and got so hot the plastic lids completely melted and ran down inside. The smokless powder was contained mostly in 8 lb cardboard or metal kegs. The kegs were charred badly enough that the paper labels burned completely off and in the case of the metal cans, the plastic lids melted completely away. Many of the rounds cooked off. They were in close proximity to wood on all sides so the effects were easy to observe. In most cases with the rifle ammo, the cartridge cases ruptured in the middle. Many bullets were found still in the neck. Small shards of brass were lightly stuck into the wood. Lightly enough that brushing them with a fingertip would usually dislodge them. Primers generally popped out of the primer pockets. The .45ACP rounds that cooked off left empty cases and bullets laying around. No dents were observed above the storage area, indicating the bullets left the cases slowly enough not to be a hazard. Ordinary small arms ammo is NOT a hazard when cooking off regardless of what the FBI says. John -- John De Armond, WD4OQC |Interested in high performance mobility?

Lines: 131 Reply-To: oaf@zurich.ai.mit.edu NNTP-Posting-Host: klosters.ai.mit.edu In the wake of the Waco denouement, I had email discussions with people from this group. In particular, we discussed how cults operate, why the FBI might be motivated to black out news or behave the way it did, and what kinds of problems are involved in dealing with cults and similar organizations. I include an edited account of what I wrote. The identity of my correspondents have (I hope) been erased. The editing process makes the text choppy - sorry about that. I've tried to retain the information content. Ellipses (...) indicate where text was removed. A few of the comments in parentheses are new, intended to make it easier for outsiders to understand. These notes are preliminary - feel free to criticize. Cheers(?), Oded ------------------------ (begin included text) ----------------------- I took a course called the MADNESS OF CROWDS, ... The course included cults and briefly mentioned/analyzed Jonestown. (Did some external reading too). William Adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of "evil" mass movements... starting with THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY, University of Chicago Press, 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what would motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in WWII, and by extension in other wars, in racial lynchings ... I don't think the books are perfect, and the study of psychopathology has advanced ..., but you can elicit Koresh types from even the first volume. So I think they're onto something. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- How cult psychology works... [I'm an amateur. Hope I'm not hopelessly naive.] So long as Koresh could "own" his people, he made sure they didn't believe there was any life out there for them, away from him. Otherwise, he'd (Koresh) be nothing. During the siege, ex-Davidians recounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived only through his intercession with God to spare their worthless souls. Absolutely classic brainwashing technique. ... As long as they believed him, they'd ignore BATF/FBI/Child Protective Services or even the Red Cross asking them to come out. After all, if they ever left him, God would catapult them straight to Hell, and the combined forces of the US gummint, with all the goodwill in the world (doubtful) couldn't save them for a second. If I believed it, I'd stay and die too, like the folks in Jonestown. For a prosaic analogy, replace a cult leader with an estranged wife (or husband), and notice how many folks show up, kill the ex and then themselves. That's the consequence of shattered "cultism." It really does happen all the time. [By the way, the treasured ideal in such cases, without which life is meaningless, is the relationship, no matter how abusive, rather than the individual's partner.] ... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [Why No News, Don't The Feds Owe The World An Explanation?] I agree that official explanations are in order. I can also see good (?) reasons for news blackouts. > The only fact available is that had the FBI not acted > yesterday, those people would be alive today. ... that no matter what, those people would have died, because Koresh made sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence. Hence it would make little difference when or how the FBI acted. He held them hostage, as his trump against going to jail, but nothing would really stop him from offing them. Even if the FBI went away! Look at history. Rep Leo Ryan (and some staffers) visited Jonestown, at the request of constituents who had relatives there. Once Jonestown was discovered, and even though they killed Ryan and his entourage ... they all killed themselves, because Jim Jones knew he'd be busted. Internal arguments asking to spare the children, brought up by some of the women in the cult, were shouted down. There are tapes... The "logic" of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is, it wouldn't kill the kids, was shouted down as blasphemy, and the people who brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by THEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the hour. I suspect it's the same with the Branch Davidians. (There's a book on Jonestown by James Reston Jr., titled OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HELL. I don't know whether it's good - never read it.) ... The only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate reports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment, or organizations buying full-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS, on the off chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ... So, the only way the BATF/FBI could "save" those people, and future cults, is by ignoring such signs. I suppose there's another way - outsmarting Koresh and tricking him into letting them go, or somehow influencing "his" people to abandon him while he owns most of their means of communication with the world. ... a mighty tough row to hoe. ... I suspect the FBI tried to do that with blackouts, noise and other sensory insults. However, maybe they're not very sophisticated, or maybe the job is impossible. It's certainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk. ... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [Why the FBI might want to blackout during and coverup after] ... - if they were doing a poor job of weaning the BD's from Koresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so they wouldn't be embarrassed. ... - if they were trying to wean the BD's from Koresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so he couldn't outflank them, or well-meaning boneheads from ANY point of view wouldn't screw it up. ... I _hate_ playing chess when the world screams in my face, especially if at checkmate time people really die, and I could be blamed. ... I don't think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy, unless you deny the FBI, BATF, Child Protective Services (of whatever stripe) and the rest of the gummint should exist at all. (the end) ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay, have at it.	0

I didn't notice that. Apologies to those who were confused. The substance makes little sense unless one reads the prior messages. However, I don't wish to enter into this discussion here, as it will be yet another rehearsal of a long-tired set of arguments. Suffice it to say that I disagree both with the interpretation of "well-regulated" in the Second Amendment offered by gun lovers, and what I think to be their distortion of the same phrase in the associated Federalist papers. My Webster and my reading of the language convinces me that the word meant both under control, and disciplined, and not 'of good marksmanship'. I think the latter a special interest pleading. No one has yet shown a contemporateous reference in which "well regulated" unambiguously meant 'of good marksmanship', and not under control/disciplined, etc. Thus I continue to believe the Second Amendment is a militia clause and not an 'arming everyone' clause. Others are welcome to disagree (as I know many do) and little would be served by rehashing this topic in this particular forum.

The third was to stay inside. Last time I checked, "amassing an arsenal" and practicing any kind of religion were mentioned in passing in the Bill of Rights. Guess it's OK with you if we just brush 'em aside in order to justify killing a bunch of religious nutcakes, eh? Of all the idiots I run into in daily life, Dan, your type scare me the most. You'll accept expediency and a coward's safety over any belief just as long as the government tells you to. You assume that anyone who doesn't comform to your beliefs and ways of thinking are wrong and therefore bad. Worse, you seem to accept without question what the government says is wrong to be wrong. David Koresh's religion was not mine but then again, neither are the baptists, methodists, catholics or any of the rest of the corporate religions. BUT even though Koresh's, the Baptists, the methodists, etc, don't believe the same way I do, I recognize that their religions are equally valid to mine and more importantly are equally protected under the 1st Amendment. You see, I'm not that much different than Koresh and I suspect many others fit the same catagory. I read the Bible many times and as I learned from it, I discovered that a lot of what corporate religions practice just isn't justified by MY interpretation of the Bible. Therefore I go my own way. So did Koresh. And neither you nor I nor anyone else, either individually or collectively as the great socialist "we" has ANY RIGHT WHATSOEVER to tell me or you or Koresh that our religions are wrong. You seem to think that it would have been oh so easy for the Davidians to just forsake everything they believed in and walk out of their compound in order to "save themselves". Think (if you're capable) for a moment about some belief you hold dearest. Would you abandon that belief if suddenly told to do so by the government? If you would do so you are beneath contempt. Let's assume you have a belief that you hold dear enough to commit your life to. Do you think it would be the correct course of action for your government to initiate actions specifically designed to force you to make that "forsake or die" decision? The "forsake or die" option is exactly what the government forced on the Davidians the day the first wave of black-clad stormtroopers fired that first shot and tossed that first grenade. The FBI clenched it on Day 51 when they sent in heavy armor against 80-some-odd men, women and children holed up in a rickety old building and armed with small arms. The people who stayed, who held to their beliefs over personal safety, whose individual personal honors demanded they die rather than submit, who believed that the Bill of Rights meant exactly what it says, to those people go my deepest respect, regardless of their religion. People like you who blithely blow off the murder of 80 people with "well they could have come out" get my most scornful contempt. I'd spit in your face were there not a network between us.

Sounds a bit >>tacky, but hey, whatever works. As David Veal points out, this sort of "promotion" would be used against gun owners by the mass media. However, here is my proposal: offer gun safety classes in your area, free, as a community service. Such a class would normally cost $40 or $50, so offering it free is a good promotion. Our Gun Club has organized several of these (we just finished teaching another one last night, in fact) and they have been very well received. We get a lot of people who are novices interested in guns. We even get a few who are anti-gun, but feel they should know something about "gun safety" since members of their family keep guns at home. Teaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits: (1) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats. (2) A "gun safety" class is Politically Correct, and likely to be viewed positively by the public and the media. (3) Most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts) and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a gentle introduction to firearms. (4) Some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun and become more involved in shooting or personal defense. (5) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners in general. Our students see that we are all reasonable, non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate the standard image of a hardcore gun owner. Even anti-gun students sometimes tell us they have "something new to think about" with regards to personal gun ownership. (6) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun. Our course is the standard NRA-certified "Home Firearm Safety" class, and our students pay only $5 for materials. We also teach the NRA's "Personal Protection" class, although the cost is higher for that one since we have to purchase range time. I think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to gun buy-backs. -- Alane -- /-----------------------------------------------------------------\ / NOBODY shares my opinions, | "I am a jelly doughnut" \ / especially not my employer | -- President John F Kennedy \ /-----------------------------------------------------------------------\	0

212	From: jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu Subject: BATF & FBI Do Right Thing in Waco Lines: 44 Everyone is complaining about the debacle in Waco. It is hard to understand all this angst. What happend there is nothing less than what we wanted to happen. Why all the sour grapes ? BATF was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impending budget cuts ... the attendance of the press at the initial big commando raid is proof. It would have been ever so easier to grab Koresh and his central followers as they shopped in Waco. Alas, no propaganda value there. The FBI screwed-up big time, all the time. They should have never allowed the situation to drag out like that. A quick second assault, before the BDs could decide on a strategy, would have been the better plan. The BDs themselves were the biggest screw-ups though. They imagined that US law and US law-enforcement had no jurisdiction within their little 'country'. WRONG ! They had no right whatsoever to fire on the BATF, and if they mistook their identity initially, they should have surrendered at once when they did realize who they were. If the BDs had a problem with the warrants, they take it to court, just like the rest of us. If they wanted full-auto weapons, they could have obtained the proper permits, just like the rest of us would need to do. What they may NOT do is decide for themselves what US law applies to themselves and which does not. They get their chance like the rest of us - at the voting booth. If the BATF and FBI have become latter-day Gestapo, then they have become that way because WE have desired them to be so. We get to vote on laws, and on the lawmakers. By our choices over the years, we have approved the creation and form of the BATF and FBI. When the FBI was out chasing 'pinkos', the general public didn't seem to mind a bit of extra-constitutional activity. When the BATF is raiding militant black organizations, we don't mind the heavy hand. When the FBI is dicking around with the rights of potheads, the public doesn't mind. Suddenly, when we see a bit of ourselves in the current 'enemy' choosen by these agencies, we get all bent out of shape. SUPRISE ! You reap what you sow. Waco was an encapsulation of the All-American experience - religious fanaticism, militaristic thinking and overwhelming violence. Don't blame it on 'them', the FBI and BATF. They were just acting within the parameters we have set over the years. We made 'them'. We ARE 'them'. -- Jim Mason	0

No, because "we" have decided that it doesn't make enough difference to "us" to get up and do something. That's something, for instance, a lot of people who go speak against gun control bills at their local government. Dozens of "pro-gun" speakers show up and few if any antis do, but they often win anyway. Why? Because it doesn't matter who shows up, it matters who's willing to scream afterwards.

The paucity of this line of argument is that it is provably false. Texas state officials COULD and DID investigate child abuse charges. They COULD and DID apprehend Koresh peaceably. The COULD and DID impound his weapons for the duration. And Koresh was NOT CONVICTED. Note that child abuse and similar accusations are STATE matters, not federal. The state COULD and DID handle them properly and peaceably, and furthermore violating no one's constitutional rights in the process.

What I saw was an unnecessary, unprovoked massive attack on Feb. 28th. Probably even an illegal action by ATF, certainly way out of proportion to anything reasonable. And yet, according to a pole taken yesterday, 95% of the people poled believe the government forces acted appropriately. They don`t believe Reno or the President have any guilt in ordering/allowing the attack. I suppose they also believed things like: "I would present a 5-year plan to balance the budget." "We don`t need to lead with a tax increase...." "It starts with a middle-class tax cut..." "I`ll have the bills ready the day after I am inaugurated and we`ll have a 100 day period....It will be the most productive in modern history." "I will ask congress for a line item veto.." "I will lift the social security earnings test.." I personally prefer to disbelieve the government until they prove themselves right, rather than the other way around. That way I have a better than 50% chance of being right about my first guess! Read the constitution sometime, it is supposed to protect the citizens and their rights. I am sick of the abuse of government power. As Tom Jefferson said: "When all government,..., shall be drawn to Washington as the centre of all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated."

(Flames to /dev/null) --------- Begin Enclosed Article ----------- THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT by J. Neil Schulman If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan, right ? And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call would be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it. But who would you call if you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ? That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system. Mr. Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of "American Usage and Style: The Consensus." A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's expertise. Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at USC. Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for "Editor and Publisher", a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field. He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert. Copperud's fifth book on usage, "American Usage and Style: The Consensus," has been in continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award. That sounds like an expert to me. After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent the following letter: "I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in English usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, and extract the intent from the text. "The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.' "The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.' "I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent. Further, since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under oath to support, if necessary." My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment, then concluded: "I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter. I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment. While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results, I ask that you do this because of that importance." After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political subject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity): [Copperud:] "The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a clause. It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb 'shall'). The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia. "In reply to your numbered questions: [Schulman:] "(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?" [Copperud:] "(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people." [Schulman:] "(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted by the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringed'?" [Copperud:] "(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence is assumed. The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia." [Schulman:] "(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact necessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed' null and void?" [Copperud:] "(3) No such condition is expressed or implied. The right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia. No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state. The right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence." [Schulman:] "(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?" [Copperud:] "(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as previously stated. It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia." [Schulman:] "(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,' 'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?" [Copperud:] "(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military." [Schulman:] "(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200 years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated." [Copperud:] "To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment. If it were written today, it might be put: "Since a well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.' [Schulman:] "As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second Amendment to the following sentence, "A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be infringed.' "My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be, "(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?; and "(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?" [Copperud:] "(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure. "(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation." Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his cover letter: "With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach any conclusion." So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right. As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the Soviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power. And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely. American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms, guaranteed by the Constitution. And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the rest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing. it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right. no one else will. No one else can. Will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding them as representing us if they do? Will we continue obeying judges who decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ? Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution of the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?

These people are chosen for their intelligence, education, loyalty to the government, etc. They are given much intensive training. So, to all of you who refuse to believe there could be any conspiracy here, and say that the FBI was just stupid, I say I don't believe it. 2) The FBI has acces to the latest in audio and video technology -- the latest digital systems. The FBI can manufacture evidence. Need a tape of Koresh saying, "light the fire", and you can have one. Need a thermal imaging video of three people lighting fires, and through the magic of computer graphics, you can have one. The thing is, manufacturing these pieces of evidence takes time. So it may be a few more days before we get to see them. Or maybe we just haven't heard any tapes or seen any FBI video is because it is: 1) classified 2) too gruesome for our eyes 3) lost/got coffee spilled on it Dwayne Jacques Fontenot BTW, I get my information from live video feeds.

Forensic experts will study the rubble and ashes of the Branch Davidian compound, where at least 85 people, including 24 children, perished in smoke and fire caused by theapocalyptic visions of a manipulative madman AND A STUNNING LAPSE IN JUDGMENT BY FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS. [emphasis added by me] Investigators will re-create conditions at the compound and identify accelerants and other fac- tors fueling the inferno. That is their strong suit. But the public must question why agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation lacked the oper- ational skill and teh behavioral insight to resolve the 51-day standoff free of flames and fury. The loss of life most clearly reflects the demen- tia of cult leader David Koresh, whose personal delusiosn are now seared on the public conscious- ness. His assembly of Davidians had stockpiles of arms--and had used them. LIttle in the way of rationality could be expected from Koresh, a self- confsesed "sinner without equal." What continues to mystify are th eactions of federal agents, who bungled the case from the start. The misadventure began on Feb. 28 when 100 agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, To- bacco and Firearms storemd the compound, intent on seizing Koresh and a cache of automatic weap- ons. Four agents and an estimated six cult mem- bers died inteh ensuing gun battle. Earlier oppor-tunities to isolate and arrest Koresh outside the complex had not been adequately explored. Authorities prepared a siege and resolved that those deaths would be the last. Fifty-one days into the siege there was no public outcry to storm the compound. It had been correctly perceived that the chil- dren inside "Rancho Apocalypse" were essentially hostages. With their lives at stake, there was no reason for the government to be impatient. The government's superior firepower, control of water and utilities and freedom of movement created the conditions for a belated but bloodless resolution. Neither Attorney General Janet Reno nor the FBI has provided a sigle compelling reason for abandondoning the course of patience. If intelligence was accurate and Koresh was growing increasingly violent and bizarre, it is diffi- cult to see how a tear-gas attack launched by an M-60 combat vehicle would clear his mind. If re- ports of escalating child abuse were accurate, they would have to be weighted against the potential for eve ngreated hamr. etc etc tec.... [paragraphs, 2.5 paragraphs deleted] But some of the responsibility rests with Clinton, and inexperienced president who did not pay enough attention to the life-and -death decisions being made on WAco. If Reno is to be faulted for anything, ti would be for her overreliance on the judgment of law en- forcement officers--a common problem among prosecutors. Full investigations into th eWaco tragedy must be conducted by both the executive and legislative branches. The first step is to verify how the blaze started. Though apportioning blame will play a role, it is of greater importnace to find strategies to elude the fire next time. [end of editorial] -J. Case Kim kim39@husc.harvard.edu	0

242	From: cathy@LANCE.ColoState.Edu (Cathy Smith) Subject: NO SURRENDER -- Lenda Jackson Nntp-Posting-Host: blanca.lance.colostate.edu Organization: Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523 Lines: 106 NO SURRENDER! Delivered by Lenda Jackson at the RKBA Rally in Denver, April 18, 1993 It is a fact of modern life that urban residents, particularly women, feel threatened. A certain number of them actually are threatened. There are immediate threats, the things that women will tell you they're afraid of. The noise downstairs at night. The lonely walk to the car. The stranger at the door. The abusive husband, finally kicked out of the house as he threatens to hurt her and their children. The burglar... The mugger...the rapist. And what are we told is the solution? Move. Get a dog. Keep the door locked. Call the police. as a next-to-last resort, learn martial arts. and always, there's the implied question "what's a pretty little thing like you doing without a husband around to protect you? But what if you don't like dogs? Like living alone? Don't have 10 years to devote learning judo? What if, after examining the facts, a woman learns that "rape victims using armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed - and were less likely to be injured(Kleck,124) than those using any other form of resistance (Kleck,126) (also true for robbery/assault)(Kleck,123) What if, to our horror and despair, we find that citizens cannot depend on the police for effective protection - they usually respond after a crime has been committed. In truth, the Supreme Court has held that the police are not responsible for protecting any individual, only the whole community. As a society, are we going to ask women, once again, to sacrifice themselves? Are we going to continue to deny women the ability to help themselves? Here's a thought. Neil Smith, in his book The Probability Broach, says "no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110- pound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out." But if a woman decides to protect herself, with the easiest, most efficient means possible, people - especially other women - are horrified. "Eughh, how could you? I'd be terrified!" they ask. How could you hurt someone? They'll repeat the lie: it'll just get taken away from you. In truth, 1% of "defensive gun uses" result in the offender taking the gun away from the victim.(122,Kleck) Well, despite the lies, and the social pressure, some of us have already made that hard choice. We've decided that we are not going to be victimized by the muggers, burglars or rapists. We're buying more guns than every before. We're learning how to use them - and teaching others, women and men, how to use them. Most importantly, we are preparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense. We're taking our own security, literally, into our own hands. We're going to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WE INTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE NIGHT. But there's another threat, more insatiable than any mugger, more secretive than any burglar, more soul-destroying than any rapist. That menace is government, and it threatens us all. We know that governments, throughout time, have suppressed rights and oppressed people. It's the way they survive. In our names and with our money, it interferes with innocent people both at home and abroad. It lies to us, cheats us, steals from us and threatens us with violence. No one knows exactly what it'll do next - what freedom we will lose because some government goon decides "it's for your own safety" or "we know best". Any person who acted like government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his life and locked up as a habitual offender. But this monster called government persists, and grows. And we, who should be its masters, have become its unwilling slaves. Do you doubt me? Then why did you file your income tax? Like any reasonable person, I believe that being afraid of something that can hurt you is smart, and that paranoia isn't crazy if someone's really after you. And make no mistake, they're after you and they're after me. Their names are familiar: Brady and Reynolds, Groff, Metzenbahm, Moynihan, and Clinton. If we're lucky, they'll settle for our assault rifles, our shotguns, our handguns and our ammunition. As citizens, we have only two choices. They are the same two choices given to women: to surrender or to fight. Surrender leads to the gulag, to the genocide of Pol Pot, to the disappearances, to Dachau. I do not intend to surrender. A battle can be philosophical or political: in the main, the people keep the government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. But if they have to, they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson: "the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots." As a patriot, I will point out the error in the government's ways. I will do my best to vote the villains out of office. I will protest, and write, and speak, and teach our children justice, honor and truth. And always remember that Rebellion can lead to Bunker Hill and Saratoga......or it can lead to Tiananmen Square. When the time comes to stand up, if I have to give my life to keep them from going too far, if there is a Tiananmen Square in our future, I intend to be there. And no matter what lies they tell and no matter what laws they pass, I intend to meet them with something more substantial in my hand than a brick. My opinions are, of course, my own.	0

Lines: 87 ------------------------- Original Article ------------------------- The Colorado Daily recently reprinted the Wall Street Journal's article on Paxton Quigley, including the nefarious little paragraph the Journal tacked onto the end. After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G. type folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph, and surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it. The text follows. The Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student (I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess... (The title was the only thing they changed/added) "Gun Stats" The Daily recently reprinted an article from the Wall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton Quigley, author of "Armed and Female." The article, in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. The article states, "A study... found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder." This is an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev- eral reasons, outlined below: The study gives the impression that, if you own a gun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned against you. The study, however, fails to take into account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun to thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe- trator. The study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather than 'friend'. This would include the friendly neigh- borhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every month, the second your grandmother cashes her social security check. Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a friend. The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis- position of cases and fails to take into account cases originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be self-defense. Especially considering the small sample size (396), taking these events into account has a sub- stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted. Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif- erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be used, successfully, by a private citizen against an aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all. Further, per- sons defending themselves from aggression by using a gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by some other means, or who offer no resistance at all. Statistics available from the FBI and other agencies also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times more likely to be used to defend against a criminal threat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit suicide. It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics. One has to consider carefully what questions were asked by those gathering the data before one can draw an accu- rate conclusion from them. D.F.

Right. For six hours you know that a tank could come thru the wall at any point, and you leave a COLEMAN LANTERN BURNING.

Jason - I've heard the people who are talking about this dismissed as conspiracy nuts, but nobody seems to be talking about a conspiracy, at least at the beginning. There were a lot of bad decisions that went into this tragedy, and some people may now be taking some serious evasive action to avoid being held responsible for the unexpected results of those bad decisions. Actually, the only ones I see that are tied into a conspiracy theory are the ones raving about deranged cultists with stockpiles of weapons and suicide pacts. >Admittedly mistakes were made but why attribute them to malice rather >than stupidity?

The FBI said they found some folks who had been shot in the head, and the medical examiner said "we have not seen evidence of this". At the time the medical examiner said that, they were dealing with charred bodies in the compound - this sounds like typical medical examiner not releasing details until a thorough investigation.

Now, even assuming that the figure isn't calculated like the Feds do a drug siezure, for 90 people, that isn't really all that much (you priced decent guns lately?). Hell, I can think of a person right now that probably has that much for ONE INDIVIDUAL, mostly machineguns!!! Sure, he is an avid collector, but unless a new law has been passed, it is NOT illegal, nor an indication of anything illegal, to have a lot of guns. Also note that the warrant had NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT MACHINE GUNS. So, what is the justification of this cowboy raid, other than a romp gone bad for some anti-gun media hype, to support Clinton's push for disarming the unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapons?

And our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people who need restricting and not remove them from the people who don't. A fairly simple problem, given our size and numbers. Do you agree? We all believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have firearms. The problem is making a law that does this without trodding upon the rights of the vast majority. Nobody here seems to be able to do it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either. Thus, we are left with a philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting the many? We say "no," while others say "yes." >Now IF you would like to reduce the number, how would you do it without >affecting good/responcible gun owners ?? Can you provide a method that cannot be abused? I doubt it. >I DO believe in a persons freedom. >What I don't believe is that you can have it all and don't pay for it. Of course. This is not in contention. What is in contention is how much one has to pay. >MOST europeans believe in a society of individuals, and that you HAVE >to give 'a little' to make that society work. It is this "giving a little" that makes Americans wary... We have seen this argument before. You might remember how a Chamberlain "gave a little" to a particular fascist/short asshole, and how such "appeasement" worked. While it might work in some instances, it doesn't work in others, and since we cannot predict the future we must be cautious in using actions that have a history of failure. >Cars and guns should really not be mixed, I just tried to make a point. >Like America, Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b, >so a car is essential in most parts.... >Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway, so we don't >argue that IF we 'banned' guns we HAVE to ban cars..... Cars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in the USA. I'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be willing to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price. Thus, cars are not essential for your transportation. However, the arguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far more people than guns in the USA, it makes much more sense to restrict cars than it does guns. How one defines "essential" often depends upon what one is willing to go through for that service. When we look at the raw data, such comparisons are not individually weighed. >EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were >more guns in Germany in the 30's: PLEASE read some HISTORY! This depends upon what the populace was willing to do. As Desert Storm proved, even an armed populace won't just revolt even when given a chance. Still, would Hitler have done all that he did with an armed populace? We have to wonder, as some of his first acts were to confiscate firearms. Other points in history show that dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace. Thus, we're left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown or if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony. One can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action. >Is this discussion about >1. Banning weapons for ALL Americans > or >2. Making it harder for criminals to get one ?? It is about #2, but so far all proposals to curtail #2 have wound up enforcing #1 as well. I only wish that "or" was so logical. >Change of name....... That was, on my part, purely in jest.

After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G. type folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph, and surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it. The text follows. The Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student (I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess... (The title was the only thing they changed/added) "Gun Stats" The Daily recently reprinted an article from the Wall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton Quigley, author of "Armed and Female." The article, in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. The article states, "A study... found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder." This is an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev- eral reasons, outlined below: The study gives the impression that, if you own a gun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned against you. The study, however, fails to take into account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun to thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe- trator. The study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather than 'friend'. This would include the friendly neigh- borhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every month, the second your grandmother cashes her social security check. Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a friend. The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis- position of cases and fails to take into account cases originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be self-defense. Especially considering the small sample size (396), taking these events into account has a sub- stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted. Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif- erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be used, successfully, by a private citizen against an aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all. Further, per- sons defending themselves from aggression by using a gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by some other means, or who offer no resistance at all. Statistics available from the FBI and other agencies also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times more likely to be used to defend against a criminal threat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit suicide. It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics. One has to consider carefully what questions were asked by those gathering the data before one can draw an accu- rate conclusion from them. D.F.

"I'll come out as soon as I finish my manuscript on the Seven Seals." Oh, OK, David. I agree that Koresh was as much of a victim as a perpetrator; this because he grew up inside the cult, and engaged in a power struggle where his supporters helped inflate his ego. That doesn't change the fact that he was a loose fucking cannon with a shitload of serious weapons. Or that he was banging thirteen year olds and twisting their impressionable little minds. This was no MOVE fuck-up. A helicoptor was thermal-imaging the compound that afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously. There were no CS CANISTERS... a specially modified Abrams was pupming the stuff in. No chance of starting a fire there. Kerosene lamps? Maybe one, but not three fires. No way. Koresh wasn't just talking out of his ass. I expected this to happen. Maybe they WANTED it to look like murder. He had 50+ days. I think this was coming the whole time. He didn't even put the children in the buried bus or the underground bunker during the CS seige. He put them up into the tower to die. Fuck all of you "Big Brother" paranoid freaks. The only good thing to come of any of this is that there will be one less group of crazoids to attract some of the more rootless members of our society. joe.kusmierczak@mail.trincoll.edu	0

To just about everyone. I keep hearing this, but every assertion of this form has come from government sources except two. As far as I am concerned, I am not ready to stipulate that Koresh EVER promised to come out except for his first promise and his last promise. The first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given NATIONAL exposure. Well, it never was -- it was broadcast locally, in a chopped-up fashion, and that's all. And even then, they cleverly cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded "national exposure," but not so cleverly that we didn't hear it. The last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript. We'll never know if he would have kept that one. > The FBI etc. can't wait forever for Koresh to come out.

What a load of crap ! The BDs had absolutely NO RIGHT to fire upon the BATF agents. If they didn't know who they were at first, then they should have surrendered immediately when they did realize who they were dealing with. Little groups of loonies do not get to decide just what laws they will obey or disobey or what sorts of warrants are justified. Like the rest of us, they get their say at the voting booth and if their personal wants are not backed by the majority of voters, then too bad. If they wanted to keep automatic weapons, then they could apply for the proper permits. If they had a problem with the warrant then they get to argue that in court. In no event do they get to establish their own little nation inside our own and pretend that our laws and law-enforcement personel have no jurisdiction within their borders. You live on US territory, you live by US laws - period. (unless you are a congressman) Sure, the situation was handled badly by both the BATF and the FBI. It would have been all so easy to detain Koresh and his core members while they were out in the streets of Waco. The BATF, threatened with budget cuts, was trying for a propaganda coup ... and dragging the press along for the big commando-style assault is proof of that. They should be roasted for both their imcompetance and their mindset. On the other hand, they DID have the legal right to do what they did. Once the attack was begun, they should have pressed on and finished it rather than let an interminable situation like that take root. The FBI also used poor judgement in a number of ways - but again, the laws we voters have approved, or the lawmakers who created them, gave them the right to do what they did. If BATF and the FBI are latter-day Gestapo, it is because the voters have allowed them to become that way. Waco was pure Americana - militarist mentality, religious fanaticism and unadulterated violence all rolled into one experience. We get what we pay for, or vote for, and this was the result of many choices we have made over the years. Don't blame 'them' - blame ourselves. We made 'them', we ARE 'them'.	0

You have this absolutely backwards. If crime stopped in the presence of strict gun control, there is NO WAY I would consider lifting any of it.

But to think there is a visible and clear chain of command up to the Prez, and that these agencies inform Reno who informs Clinton, etc. is naive. These agencies operate as distinct and seperate entities and while they have ultimate accountability to the Prez, they make their own moves, and then tell the Prez, who says, "I knew all along". While this may not seem right, or it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of command leading to the White House, thats the way it is. Bureaucracys are not, after all, composed of 3 or 4 people who talk on a regular basis, have lunch, and maybe golf together. I do agree, the FBI, BATF messed up. I'm not sure if they should have stormed the compound or not. By the way, Jehova Witnesses are a religious minority in this country. Protestantism is a minority religion in the World. BDs were a cult by all definitions and history of cults. To say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave. Koresh said he was the Messiah. I was raised a Baptist, although I do not practice the religion and do not think that the Big Guy upstairs is digging the divisiveness, closemindedness, and right-wing morons that are associated with the religion. Anyway, the Messiah that I was taught about would not be carrying a gun, let alone stockpiling weapons. You can doubt BATF reports all you want, David Koresh was not a poor soul who was unjustly persecuted. While some of the information coming from the U.S government is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side, I do believe that some of the things that former cult members have said are true. Anyway, this is just another excuse to try and blame President Clinton for something. People who attempt to do this for political motives should be ashamed. THEY are the ones who are keeping this country from reaching its full potential.	0

If Rush's criticism of Clinton were to be applied to Reagan and North... Reagan would have been impeached while North was convicted (and overturned on a technicality). Gosh, Rush sure wants to have it both ways... Clinton MUST be held responsible, but Reagan was clever by using the "amnesia defense".

They threatened no one. Their neighbours thought they were a little strange but all in all the kind of people you would want to live next door to. One version has the BATF serving a *search* warrant by jumping out of a horse trailer with guns and tossing concussion grenades. If this is the true order of events then the 'cult' could not know that a search warrant was being served and since there was no proof that these guys were police, the 'cult' had every right to defend themselves. : Torching themselves shows briliant tactics, and convinces me : they *realy* belong in society ... If you watch actual footage of the fire from start to finish it is not at all clear that fire wasn't started by the tanks. The people who survived are claiming that the fire was started by the tanks knocking over some kerosene lanterns. The FBI is claiming that the 'cult' started the fire. 'they *realy* belong in society' is a catchy phrase but I'm personally waiting to see what the Texas Rangers have to say about it all before I pass judgment. Why don't you do the same. Some more interesting facts about the Waco incident: 1) The original assault was conducted by BATF officers wearing an assorted types of camouflage. I saw, on CNN, at least three different types. I would be hard pressed to identify a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own' battle fatigues as uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to be police. 2) The BATF has been lying from the beginning: + "We only had handguns" - the original footage showed 4 BATF officers on a roof top getting shot at, one had an MP-5 assault sub-machine gun. + "We were out gunned" - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the BEST in quarters weapon, you can't be out gunned when you have the best guns available for the job. + "We didn't know they had guns that would shoot through doors!" - this one is the best, there are very few guns that won't shoot through a household door, or through a house WALL for that matter. Since officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and *Firearms* should know that, they are either lying or incredibly incompetent. Not to mention criminally negligent if they are shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter plywood. + "We had a search warrant. Actually, we had an arrest warrant. No, wait, we had both. Yeah, that's the ticket. Oh, and they're child molesters too. And they make *drugs*. Did we mention we think they have rocket launchers." - The story from BATF and FBI spokespeople has changed daily and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous. 3) Throughout the siege the FBI and BATF have be claiming that one of their biggest concerns was that Koresh and his followers would mass suicide. Now they are claiming that that's what he did AND that they are surprised that he did. Huh? All in all I think that anything the FBI and BATF say should be taken with a grain or two of salt.

Since neither side would be particularly interested in telling the truth, you have to weigh the 'facts' given by each yourself, and weigh it with the newsreporting if you care. Many cult members will probably side with the attorney, and if he is lying, change their stories to match his. And if the Feds also lie, the cult members who become disillusioned will change their stories to match the Feds. Neither sides are interested in the truth. The Media is more interested, but usually either don't have the time to get it straight or tie themselves to the ratings and deliberately distort. For me, though, the black soot billowing outside the compound added with how fast the fire spread ponted to *someone* dousing large parts of the compound with some sort of gasoline or fire-starter. I doubt the Feds did that as they were more interested in arresting Vernon. The real unbalanced one (at least the one that lost his cool) was Vernon, so I figured that he was more likely to do it (after all he was Jesus being persecuted by the authorities, and had followers to hold onto, so made the decision. He and his followers also probably felt that they were rocketing to heaven by doing this stuff). Thsi conclusion, I came to after umpteen million hours of listening to NPR and other radio shows (I always have the radio going when I am in my office on some innocuous talk-show or news program as background noise). -- <><><><><><><><><><> Personal opinions?

Ammunition is not as dangerous when simply burned as it is when fired from a gun. The brass case is not capable of holding the pressure generated by burning powder, and will (unless supported by the walls of a gun barrel or chamber) simply split open. While this may cause small pieces of brass to fly around, it will not propel the bullet with any significant velocity. In fact, it was not uncommon in years past to dispose of old loaded cartridges by burning them. As long as you were not close enough to take a piece of flying brass in the eye, you were reasonably safe. Thus, the detonation of loaded magazines or loose rounds might cause slight injury but would be unlikely to cause fatal bullet wounds. -- Alane -- /-----------------------------------------------------------------\ / NOBODY shares my opinions, | "I am a jelly doughnut" \ / especially not my employer | -- President John F Kennedy \ /-----------------------------------------------------------------------\	0

The U.S. had agreed not to use this gas against enemy soldiers in wartime, but used it in peacetime against civilians, including nnocent children.

We should all remember that if Nixon hadn't tried to cover up the misguided actions of some of his subordinates in the Watergate burglary, the scandal would never have brought down his presidency. So far, Klinton seems to be stonewalling this the same way Tricky Dick did. His whole case seems to be "we didn't do anything wrong". However, if in the course of the investigation it turns out that the gov't DID do something wrong, and he tried to cover it up, then that's an impeachable crime, I believe...

I think it was - he went into town fairly often, and was known to go jogging. This was even during the 9 month period when he was being watched. One wonders why the BATF went ahead, when they had been warned according to an interview with a BATF agent, that the BD were expecting them, and why they had the media in tow. Almost looks like they wanted to have a romp and a nice show for the media, and it all went to hell... He was also never known to act violently. He has always surrendered peacefully before (but of course, the warrants were served peacefully). He has been tried on the allegations before and found NOT GUILTY. The justification for this mess was he was alleged to have purchased $200,000.00 worth of guns and stuff (over an undetermined time period). Last I heard this is not a crime, or indication of one. I know of an INDIVIDUAL with that much value in guns. SHould he get a fly-thru-the-door shoot-first-talk-later raid? (grenades are shooting first, nobody I know of can say 'oh, thats only a stun grenade, thats OK...'). Can you? I sure cannot. Also, one cannot be sure that 200K figure is not calculated like the Feds calculate the value of a drug siezure... Even so, it is a 'so what' issue... He wasn't bothering anyone (besides the BATF who doesn't like folks other than themselves or other govt people having any effective guns)... and having an unapproved religeous group. Are we required to not offend the BATF these days? I sure hope it hasn't come to THAT... MY point is, it DOES NOT ADD UP. We need an independent investigation, and NOW. Assuming other than FBI/BATF are preserving the evidence. >2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome. They had the premisis bugged. I am inclined to think a further wait would have saved lives. One wonders why they didn't have emergency gear on hand when they moved, and why they didn't turn on the water when a fire was observed, instead of saying "aw, gee, there is no water". Why so long before the fire gear even SHOWED UP - like after the building had pretty much finished burning? Fireman safety? Isn't that a decision the firefighters should be allowed to make? No water? Why didn't the Feds TURN IT BACK ON? They sure could cut it off quickly enough... One does wonder about the possibility of 'settling scores'... >3) Were FBI actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the "right" course of action? > >And a few other questions.

You think she is going to be facing jail time if the acts were found to be criminal? You think she is going to face ANY repercussions if the FBI/BATF are found to have acted wrongly? I don't. It is a nice PR gimmick, though. I am not assured there will even be a serious independent investigation for possible wrongdoing or criminal acts on the part of the BATF or FBI. I expect to hear "they are our best law enforcement. They wouldn't do anything like that - NO WAY. OUT of the QUESTION. End of issue". I want to see an INDEPENDENT investigation, with full prosecuting and subpoena powers. With felony prosecution where felony acts are found. Fat chance, I bet. I bet the Justice Dept will have an internal investigation which will turn up at most 'poor judgement'.

Two notes of interest from Texas: The Tarrant Couonty ME (who is doing the autopsies) is well known for rendering judgements that are contrary to the police view. He presented evidence a few years ago that a man who police said was pointing a gun at them actually had his hands in the air. This does not bode well for the boys in black. The Texas Dept. of Public Saftey and the Texas Rangers have no great love for the ATF. I have heard them referred to as "those fucking cowboys". The DPS was totally squeezed out of the BD operation and resented being left as "traffic cops". ATF now has two strikes against them. Finally (I guess that makes three notes), rumour from Waco is that four ATF agents were stopped by four Waco police cars and a DPS trooper after one of the flashed "an automatic weapon" at a cop. Lots of pissed of cops.

NO. I hate to repeat myself Jim, but like I told Joe, I was not attempting in any way to justify gun control. You're right, any death is serious. THAT was my point to Joe who said that "anti-gunners" try to convinve the country that accidental gun deaths related to children are a serious problem.

From the police who I have talked with who run some of these gun buyback programs, I get the impression that they really think they are having an impact on the community. When I ask them if they have an evaluatory component to the program, they say "well no..." So, in answer to your question, no, false hope is not the intent. I think the intent is to show folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal gun violence whether its effective or not. Look, if you can't measure the impact of these programs using some sort of pre-test and post-test evaluation, what is the point? It must be symbolic in nature. The police are essentially saying "look, if you have a gun lying around and you don't want it, we'll give you $50 for it...because we care about the community".

ABC aired a report including the 911 tapes from Monday. The FBI called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire's breakout. Unfortunately, dispatch of vehicles outside the Waco city limits required approval of a deputy chief, who was not available (literally out to lunch?); the 911 operator desperately called around to local community volunteer fire departments to get something out there. By the time trucks arrived 27 minutes later, the whole complex was aflame and it was clearly too little, too late; there were just two pumpers and no water supply. The FBI made another call requesting a tank truck, but the Waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not have one. Though clearly unwilling to risk firemen's lives in the line of fire, it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient equipment and water to make a difference. They even aired a tape of a woman who called Waco 911 from Georgia asking if anything was being done. Civic-minded, but probably irresponsible; if everyone watching television did that, no local calls could get through. ABC also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who viewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the standard "pool shot"), and agreed that the fire a) must have been started in at least 3 places, and b) must have had an accelerant to spread so fast. Neither of these is conclusive proof that the Koresh crowd offed themselves more than the FBI offed them, but it's a heck of a lot stronger proof than some of the "theories" floating around the net.

The FBI Director and the FBI SAC in overall charge should resign, or be fired for incompetence. I don't blame Reno or Clinton. They gave the FBI clear orders: don't go in unless you can do it without casualties; if you can't do that, wait it out. Those were reasonable orders.

Look, I don't want to bore everybody here with the physics of woodstoves, but they're not anything like your Caloric gas range. It takes about three hours for a woodstove to get hot enough to cook on, and afterwards you can't just "shut it off" -- it will contain hot embers for over 24 hours even after you choke it COMPLETELY. So it ain't exactly "light up the stove and cook me a batch of them pancakes, Aunt J..."

They were using 50 caliber ammunition not 50mm ammo. 50mm would be 5cm; a shell of this size would be larger than a lot of cannon shells. Snipers could have screened the people trying to put out the fire. Besides, the ranch house (not "fort apocalypse"; it was just a house despite what the FBI and ATF says) was on *fire*. The "Gun loonies" couldn't hardly have been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in flames. The FBI and ATF don't have any excuse for not having fire engines there to put out the blaze. The bastards waited until the fire was *well* under way before they called the fire department in Waco. They didn't even tell the fire department to be on standby. I sincerely hope that the FBI, ATF, Attorney General Janet Reno, and all others involved in this fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve. Someone should pay for this needless, tragic waste of human life. Sadly, these evil SOBs will probably never face justice. The media and the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it up as being solely David Koresh's fault. Sadder still, the American people will probably believe them. > Next question. > > > The problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters > to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place. This is not the problem...the problem is that we have a government that is becoming more tyrannical every day. If people decide to own guns *and* live in one place together then that is their prerogative. On the other hand, if the BDs were in posession of explosives and illegal guns then the government did have the right to search their compound. But, the allegations that the BDs were in posession of illegal weapons hasn't been proven yet, so I'm not going to conclude that the BDs broke any laws. David Koresh was accused of abusing children, but if this is his *only* crime then the presence of the ATF can't be justified. The ATF is only supposed to deal with firearms, tobacco, and alcohol violations. ATF agents are basically cigarette cops...they should stay out of other kinds of law-enforcement actions that are out of their jurisdiction. Better yet, they should be s**tcanned IMO. > The sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to > attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention. If the FBI had > had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type > raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults. Sounds like something the SS would do. Human life---children and adults alike---should be treated with respect---even if they are "heavily-armed religious wackos". David Koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone *would* come out peacefully sooner or later. The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ON THEIR HANDS! Why did they have to escalate the situation and cause this senseless tragedy? Their job is to protect the public and SAVE LIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out loud. > It really was a no win situation. Koresh had plenty of opportunity > to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 ATF officers. Instead > he ordered the murder of the children. Don't be so sure about that. I read in a newspaper today that one of the cult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that it knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on fire. This cult member also said that David Koresh had *no* intentions of committing mass suicide. David Koresh's lawyer also confirms this. Therefore, if this is true then this means that the FBI AND ATF MURDERED EVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE! Even if this is not true, the FBI and ATF still don't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the Waco fire department. Perhaps they wanted all these people to die. > In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive > the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the > suicide/murder of his other 80 followers.

Gun control isn't the only issue here. If the sick little monkeys in Washington try to use the Waco incident as a reason to ban guns then they will have demonstrated just how f***ed up they are.

According to groups like the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence (formerly the National Coalition to Ban Handguns - interesting name change, don't you think?) who include murder and suicide by firearms in the "leading causes of unintentional death) figures but *don't* include murder and suicide by other means as causes of unintentional death.

Certainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things - but the anti-gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by firearms is a *stastically serious problem*, and even if you don't use these deaths as a justification for gun control, these groups do. I'm sorry if I jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning accidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern, but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun control measures, I think the conclusion was a reasonable one. The fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may be, they are *not* a serious problem statistically speaking. >>Please explain why you think "symbolic offerings" do good. >> > My point was, gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police >departments MIGHT (I stress might) do a LITTLE (I stress little) good by >giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond >to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way.

I thought you were waffling on your view of buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully preventing accidents and heat-of-passion shootings. I have to disagree on all these counts; I can't understand how a buying guns from people who aren't intending to misuse them (obviously those who want to use guns to commit crimes aren't going to turn them in) could be construed as a positive way for police to respond to "interpersonal violence." >>I suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these "statistics" - I >>suspect you'll find if you look carefully that 135,000 is the number of >>students *estimated* to have carried *a weapon* (not necessarily a gun) >>to school at least once in the past year, and not the number of students >>who carry a gun to school daily. >> > Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence What, the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit suicide by HANDGUNS ALONE each year as the FBI says commit suicide by ALL METHODS per year?

Ah, yes, the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be such a statistical problem that a stated objective in the Healthy People 2000 document is to "enact laws in 50 states requiring manufacturers of handguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire, minimizing the likelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by children?" The agency that funded the "study" of DC which pronounced that the DC gun ban had saved X lives (yes, they actually gave us a number) on the basis of a look at the *number* of shootings rather than the *rate* of shootings?

What's this got to do with anything? Hell, when *I* was in elementary school I came home to an empty house with guns in it. Why is this a problem? I didn't touch the guns - I had been taught not to.

Note that both are legal, and a lot of "common" people qualify >for one or the other. > >-andy >-- Maybe Freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant. The thing that most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying a concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their person when they are out on the street somewhere. I'm sure that not many people are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home. Speaking as someone who lives in Illinois (the only place where the above quoted law is relevant :-)) I know that it is legal to own a handgun here (I am not taking into account city ordinances). I could care less about whether or not I can carry concealed at home. I only care about the fact that I can't carry concealed in the place where it really counts- out on the street. Freeman loves to be accurate and I can understand that (especially not) but he seems to be forgetting that accurate facts don't always replace common sense. I am not going to followup to this thread anymore because I believe that it is useless to argue these points anymore. The only thing that is happening now is that Freeman and I are "running around in circles" trying to prove each other wrong and I do not have the time to be playing games anymore. Of course now Freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlier posts but what can I do.

This includes what the government says that two survivors have said. 2) What Koresh's lawyer (who was actually inside the compound) says, including what he says that most of the survivors have said. Strange, but they seem to disagree in most important particulars. If anyone has actually seen news reports of any of the survivors speaking first-hand, feel free ot pitch in. I may have missed it.

In a situation where only one set of facts are being presented, "coming to a conclusion" is not the hallmark of an independent thinker unless it's coupled with the ability to challenge those "facts" critically.

As the walls came tumbling down and tear gas filled the air, cult leader David Koresh sprang into action. He left his third-floor bedroom and began looking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and checking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the compound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped. This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them who are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world since Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's phone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the cults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out. They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel compound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD meanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the women did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all under 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what was happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building it shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors. Hundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling the air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than the tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air, driven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks made. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to gather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle headed for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to find Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them. Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The FBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult members, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions at odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of propane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house, it tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and other flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked together with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's escaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings. Others died groping in the blackness. Frank	0

All Muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy Iraq, not to "Liberate Kuwait", The people who were killed by the invasion are more (many many more), than the ones that were killed by the Iraqis in their smaller invasion. I lived in the west, and I have seen how your media prepared you (helpless naive Americans) for a war against ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ No doubt you plan on exploiting "helpless naive Americans" for your own purposes. Hmm...let's see: Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that led to the invasion, as the CIA correctly predicted (and pretended to be surprised not to know). It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid. What would I have done: Most Muslims would choose 300 dead Kuwaitis over 200,000 dead Iraqis and 1000 dead Kuwaitis. The first case would happen if no western intervention happened, and the second case was a direct or indirect result of western envolvement. Possibly, if 200,000 Iraqis had indeed died, but this number is based on Greenpeace estimates. Greenpeace had compromised its alleged impartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental consequences of Allied miiltary action, while initially *completely* ignoring Iraq's horrible environmental crimes, starting with the dumping of millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf at Ahmadi to the blowing of over 700 oil wells. What is the real number? There has been a lot of work on this in the last two years, none of it reported as the Greenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about. The real number seems to be around 10,000, on the same order as the number of Kuwaitis killed, tortured and kidnapped during the occupation. I've included an article I recently posted below, but this is really old news. Independent Television News reported a figure around 15,000 only a few months after the war, but it was hardly reported. For the Allies to have killed 200,000 Iraqis, they would have had to kill twice the *total* number of Iraqis in Kuwait. The favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at Mutla'. This was yet another example of the American and European media playing into the hands of Iraq and its de facto allies. The destruction of the Iraqi convoy at Mutla' was portrayed as an all-out slaughter. This is simply not true. The head and tail of the convoy was bombed initially, resulting in a lot of casualties at these points. Before bombers came back, most of the rest of the Iraqi soldiers fled on foot. Furthermore, your estimates of Kuwaiti war dead if Allies hadn't invaded is completely ridiculous. You have acknowledged (certainly implicitly) that Saddam is a barbarous brute. You have acknowledged the hundreds of thousands he has been responible for killing *in his own country*. You *know* that the man he appointed as governor of Kuwait, Ali Majid, was his most brutal henchman, presiding over the near genocide of the Kurds in the late 80's and, more recently, the Shi'a. Yet, when it comes to his treatment of Kuwaitis, he is an angel. In your estimate, he would've killed *fewer* than he already had when the war started. What a joke! APn 03/09 0006 Iraq War Dead Copyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved. By NICK LUDINGTON Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON (AP) -- After the Persian Gulf War ended, the world was told that as many as 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed. At one point, even Baghdad put the toll that high, as did the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency in private. But U.S. officials have been backpedaling ever since, even though the Pentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public. Now, one former DIA analyst says the number of Iraqi troops killed may have been as low as 1,500. That conclusion by John Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the quarterly magazine Foreign Policy, represents the lowest estimate yet from U.S. defense sources. The revisions suggesting a less devastating Iraqi toll fit a pattern of vastly moderated U.S. military claims in the months after the war ended. Claims for a number of U.S. weapons also were scaled down. Despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking pictures of Iraq's disastrous retreat from Kuwait, arguments have continued unabated about what really happened in the Gulf War. Heidenrich is not the first to question the Iraqi death toll numbers that originally were aired. More that a year ago, Air Force Lt. Gen. Charles Horner, the commander of the air campaign in the Gulf War, said he believed the Iraqi military death toll was fewer than 10,000 for the entire war. The Pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of Iraqis who died in the 42-day war against the U.S.-led coalition in January and February 1991. On Monday, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Joe Gradisher reiterated past statements that "there just isn't a number," that is credible. But some current internal estimates range from 8,000 to 25,000 Iraqi troops killed, said one analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, who is familiar with the Pentagon's reports. Allied deaths were put at 146 Americans, 35 by friendly fire; 24 British, 9 by American fire; 2 Frenchmen, 1 Italian and 39 among various Arab allies. Of the postwar reassessments, the most widely publicized was the Army's reluctant acknowledgement, months later, that its touted Patriot air defense system was nowhere near so effective as claimed against Iraq's Scud missiles. The Bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the Patriot; last spring it revised the hit ratio to 60 percent. The success record of the Navy's Tomahawk high-tech cruise missile used against targets in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq also turned out to be more modest than initially indicated by the Pentagon. The first Iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in a May 1991 report by the environmental group Greenpeace, which said 100,000 to 120,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed. It estimated that 5,000 to 15,000 Iraqi civilians were also killed. The same month, published reports said the Defense Intelligence Agency estimated 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded in the air and ground campaigns -- although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate could be off by as much as 50 percent in either direction. But as more information became available, those figures gradually were revised downward. The House Armed Services Committee staff estimated 9,000 dead and 17,000 wounded after a review last year. But Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the quarterly Foreign Policy, estimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives as low as 1,500 -- with about 3,000 wounded. Heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number of bodies found and buried by U.S. troops -- 577 -- and on prisoner of war interviews. He noted that only about 2,000 of 69,000 Iraqi prisoners of war were wounded. Based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were captured, he put the number of wounded at about 3,000. Using a conservative ratio of one dead to two wounded, applicable to Third World armies like Iraq, he set battlefield deaths at 1,500. "Maybe the figures are too low," he wrote. "Maybe the real death toll on the battlefield was 2,000 or 3,000 or even 6,000. Even then, the evidence suggests a death toll of well below 100,000 -- or even 10,000." In an interview, he said the 100,000 figure was obviously off base because it would mean that virtually all the Iraqi soldiers in the Kuwait theater of operations were casualties. He said today's bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology, but rather the drawn-out conflicts such as those in Yugoslavia and Somalia.	1

On a couple of occasions on those shows Lord Owen gave away his pro-Serbian position when he made the point that much or most of the Bosnian territory then in dispute or already overrun by Serbian forces had been controlled and occupied by Serbs before WWII. It was as if he were saying that since the Serbs had previously occupied those territories and lost them during the Hitler years, they should be allowed to reconquer them today. I was familiar with this view because my father, a Yugoslav Jew who escaped to this country during the war, was aided and found sympathy among the Serbs during those harrowing years. In recent months when the subject of Serbian aggression was mentioned, my father would make the point that 850,000 Serbs were killed by Nazi and pro-Nazi Croatian forces known as the Ustasha. My father is so pro-Serbian that he dismissed reports of Serbian atrocities. My father also excoriated New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis, because, my father said, Anthony Lewis "is always talking about the Muslims." Update--April 28, 1993 After an uneasy truce in and around Sbernica, shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and the killing and the misery continues apace while the Clinton administration dithers its response. In the days leading to the collapse of resistance at Sbernica, Lord Owen changed his tune. Previously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds that it would endanger U.N. relief workers. When Serbian forces began to march on Sbernica, the threat to U.N. relief soldiers went unmentioned while Lord Owen called for outside intervention to stop Serbian aggression, including the use of air strikes. The current disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the West and a failure of the Vance-Owen initiative which did nothing to halt the Serbs. Now that it's too late to save Muslim areas that Lord Owen felt should be in a Muslim state, Lord Owen belatedly calls for strong action. CLINTON AND BOSNIA In the summer of 1992, George Kenney, a senior State Department official, the undersecretary in charge of the Yugoslav desk, made news when he resigned from the State Department because of the Bush administration's refusal to take any action to halt Serbian aggression. As Kenney saw it, Bush's inaction was largely due to the president's unwillingness to risk any political capital by getting involved there. Apparently the same is true of the Clinton administration. Clinton gives the impression that he cares more than Bush did about the terrible ongoing tragedy, but the practical effect has so far been the same. According to the New York Times, (4/16/93) the Clinton administration did everything it could to suppress a mid-March report by its own experts which called for military action if necessary to protect "safe havens" for the Muslims. At one point, Senate majority leader, George Mitchell was so incensed that the report was kept from Congress, that he called for an investigation. Instead of helping the desperate Bosnians, Clinton has signalled again and again that Milosevic and the Serbs are free to do what they want in Bosnia--indeed, Clinton and the West have been signalling that the Serbs should get on with the job and finish off the Bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other way. A key signal was when Clinton made it clear that he would NOT send in American military forces on the ground. On this issue, Clinton has made me wistful for Bush. Bush and Baker could not have done worse, and might have been pressured to do better well before this time. Lives in Bosnia might have been saved and the destruction might have been curtailed.. The Nation, the left and "the Bosnian QUANDARY" Typical of the left's inability to come to grips with the core issue involved in Bosnia, i.e., a clear aggressor destroying hundreds of thousands of lives, is the editorial on the "Bosnian quandary" in The Nation (4/26/93). In the end the editorial votes to do nothing, even while noticing "the ghastly atrocities of the Bosnian Serbs" and that the "greater and lesser powers...dither and fuss [and] hang back." ("Before anything else happens, the Clinton Administration ought to pay the $530 million the United States owes the" U.N. the editorial concludes.) In its most striking passage, the editorial writer warns that "those who are pushing President Clinton to intervene on the side of the Bosnians had better review U.S. foreign policy since World War II." The editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the Bosnian Serbs are no worse than any number of U.S. clients including the Chileans, the South Africans, the Greek fascists and others. (In a subsequent column for The Nation, Christopher Hitchens correctly called this editorial, "contemptible.") *** William Pfaff, a European based journalist who writes for the The New Yorker and the Los Angeles Times, is among a group of liberal columnists like Anthony Lewis, and Leslie Gelb who have clearly and consistently called for strong Western and American intervention to stop the Serbs. Pfaff's most recent column (Liberal Opinion Week 4/19/93) is entitled "International Cowardice Worsened Bosnian Tragedy." He clarifies the international failure which has led to present situation in one sentence. "Having refused to intervene to sanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent Croatia in June 1991, or to block or penalize the military aggression by Serbia that immediately followed, and the atrocious "ethnic cleansing" which followed that, the United Nations now contemplates deploying in Bosnia military force on a scale which two years ago could have deterred the horrors Yugoslavia has since experienced." He goes on to explain that U.N. plans now envisaged call for a "more daunting and open-ended military assignment than a direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have been a year ago." Aryeh Neier on the Serbs In his "Watching Rights" column in the The Nation (5/3/93) Aryeh Neier gets to the heart of the motivation of the "aggressors"--the preferred term for the Serbian forces who have been besieging and shelling Sarajevo for more than a year. He explains that "there is no military purpose that is served by the destruction of its fabric and its people...Above all, few of those aligned with the forces attacking Sarajevo would want to live there even if the city could be rebuilt. They are not city people. "It is this, I believe--aside from a desire to break the morale of Bosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at any price--that explains the conduct of the siege of Sarajevo...[I]t is a loathing for all that is urban, pluralist and cosmopolitan that has made Sarajevo the object for devastation. "Historically, most of the Serbian population in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been rural, while Muslims, who were the civil servants and intelligentsia during the centuries of Ottoman rule, made up a disproportionate share of the urban population....The destruction of Sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility against this city; it is also an attack on the urban idea....The demagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war exploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred for all that is cosmopolitan." The light that Neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is at stake. The Serbs represent the know-nothing, anti-secularist, fundamentalist, fascist forces who are attacking the urban, cosmopolitan, secular, multi-cultural idea. They are attacking the rest of us, just as Hitler did. One irony is that at the beginning of the crisis over Bosnia, it was for awhile maintained by the Serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a threat by the Bosnian Muslims to create a fundamentalist state. Neier has shown that it is the Serbs who are the great threat to secularism, multi-culturalism, diversity and democracy. It's the Serbs who are attacking the democratic notion, the democratic idea. Anthony Lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does respect for Clinton's presidency "depend...on his acting effectively against Serbian aggression?...First of all because to do nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values we and our allies profess." (Times, 4/26/93) But it's not merely a betrayal of our values. It's because the Serbs are attacking us by proxy, just as Hitler was. One argument for decisive action by the West that is heard in a different form, is that war in the Balkans is destablizing for Europe. We hear it as, the Bosnians are Europe's Palestinians; that is to say, just as the Palestinian refugee problem has been the key to instability in the Middle East, just so will the hundreds of thousands of Yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities result in turmoil in Europe for decades to come. One of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though the Atlantic Ocean divides us, the Americas are ultimately tied to the destiny of Europe. If Europe is destabilized, the U.S. will inevitably be affected and drawn into its problems. As in a whirlpool, sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom. And as past history and Pfaff have shown, it's much better if we do so decisively, quickly and on our terms. Sincerely, Ronald Bleier	1

The reasons are pragmatic: even if >Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under >Turkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any >clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality. In fact, although I am forced to disagree with you. First of all, one may have been born from a non-Turkish, non-Muslim parent outside the Turkish land, yet still can be a Turk, provided this person calls himself or herself a Turk. Because the designation of a Turk is not a genetic feature, not a racial or religious feature. It is a matter of identifying with the Turkish values. Secondly, the following observations by Westerners were written in French by Ahmet Cevat: "If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the nations which they brought under their power, to which no one could have opposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so. They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody "to worship in their own way" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus, in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and where accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian countries."[1] "The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came under their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It was a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of Russian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a Romanian nation today" (Popescu Ciocanel). "Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without interfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy of minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced European countries."[2] "...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw is older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples of this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into action, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves happy!" (A. de Mortraye).[3] "Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years, and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to appear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey, however, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities, local courts immediately take them under their protection." "In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are living together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and the synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is more free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this sect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the dead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in the Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical processions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing their crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them which forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of priests."

Let's take Sarkis Atamian's (an Armenian Dashnak sociolog) book, "The Armenian Community", pages 97 and 105. Atamian quotes: "... the immediate question concerned itself with the organization and tactics of revolution. The liberation of Armenia, the immediate aim of the Party, was to be attained by: 1. Oral and written propaganda. 2. Terrorism - both as punishment against the enemy and as a measure of self defense. 3. The creation of an avant-garde of revolutionary groups to be equipped and prepared for action when other nations were prepared for a general uprising. 4. The organization of larger committees to be in constant contact with each other and subject to a central body. 5. Organization of units of guerilla fighters." Now, on page 105, Atamian's book quotes of Armenian constitution: "... If the means was revolution, how was the revolution to be attained? By: 1. Propaganda 2. Preparation of combat units and their indoctrination 3. Encouragement of the revolutionary morale of the people 4. The arming of the people 5. Organization of revolutionary committees 6. Espionage throughout the country and the exchange of information with the official bodies and journals 7. Organization of financial zones for public collection 8. 'Fighting and using' the weapon of the terror on corrupt government officers, spies, traitors, grafters, and all sorts of oppressors 9. Defense of the people against attacks from the brigandry 10. Building of roads for the transport of arms 11. Wrecking and looting of governmental institutions." Many of the recent Armenian terrorist acts against the Turkish people were committed by the brainwashed members of the "Tzeghagron", namely, "race-worshipers" of the Dashnag Youth Organization. Ironically, again, Tzeghagron was set up by an undisputed Armenian Nazi, Karekin Nejdeh, in 1941 (see Atamian, loc cit, page 389).

Since the gross numbers aren't the same, we'll need a proportionality value. Should we use: * Gazan vs Jewish initial population? * Gazan vs Jewish death rates? * Gazans vs Jews who survived five years of occupation? * Israelis vs Nazis attacked by the 'resistance'? * Israelis vs Poles charged with aiding the victims? Since the two cases are so comparable, it shouldn't matter which we pick, they'll all be about the same, right? ------------ Contrary to popular hyperbole, the IDF *could* quite easily kill off the entire population of Gaza in hours if they wanted to. (No, I'm not exaggerating. And I really don't want to discuss how.) Note that a million dead Gazans don't get much more headline space than a dozen, and are just as soon forgotten -- and once exterminated, they can't keep popping up as headlines. So if a "Final Solution" for Gaza would be so much better from a *Realpolitik* standpoint, why doesn't Israel go for it? A difficult question to answer for those who can't believe anything good about Jews, and probably why they keep trying to force-fit the facts into the theory. --- D. C.

If somebody wishes to counter the reality she described, fine. [PTS] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [PTS] [PTS] [PTS] The Conflict Over Nagorno-Karabakh: An Azeri Perspective [PTS] -------------------------------------------------------- [PTS] By Alec Rasizade [PTS] [PTS] [AR] Western readers have learned of the Nagorno (Upper) Karabakh [AR] controversy through reports from that remote area by Western [AR] correspondents and from commentaries by member of the long-established [AR] Armenian-American community. Azeri views on this dispute have [AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media. Therefore let me [AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the [AR] origins of the conflict. During the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject, a small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri. The following should be interesting. [AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and [AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic. Actually, [AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian [AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988, [AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia. Following that move, [AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait [AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990. This not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an independent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September 1991, page 28, we read: "By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000 Armenian inhabitants fled the city..." Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away." In this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian pogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988! [AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that [AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule [AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of "divide and [AR] rule." Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year [AR] history of the conflict. It is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the perpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions. [AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in [AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an [AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed. Those interested in [AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian [AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran. Incorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an agreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno- Karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict. [AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri [AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and [AR] adjacent rural districts. Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the [AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly [AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly [AR] nationalistic National Independence Party. It's called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian culture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The Azeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and play dead. [AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country [AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed? In the [AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish [AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government [AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and [AR] possessions? The Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they attempted to deprive Armenians of "lands, homes, and possessions". [AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West. [AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian [AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible, [AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus. True, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach! [AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea. [AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western [AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security [AR] alliances. These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led [AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed [AR] May 15, 1992. On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the [AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct. [AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces. Western interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into this conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of Europe (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia! Dr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would have us believe. [AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an [AR]"Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan." The truth is that the Armenians [AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century. Incorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish claim. Armenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as "Artsakh", which comes from the Urartian term "Urtekhe-Urtekhini". NO Azeris yet! Ancient Greeks referred to Artsakh as "Orkhistena". NO Azeris yet! In the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid Armenia of Media. NO Azeris yet! From the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom of Ervan. NO Azeris yet! Artsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or Artsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet! After Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 A.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet! End of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the Aranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet! By the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet! Emperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen "To Armenia". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet! In the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area was stated as 11,000. It was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central Asia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence in the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh! In 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some Muslims in Karabakh! In 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188 priests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian percentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh -- assuming no Kurds! Consider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920: "The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh, Zangezur, and Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis Republic. Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet Armenia and Azerbaidzan! Chairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan N. Narimanov People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Guseinov" [AR] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their [AR] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh, after it came under Russian [AR] rule. No, incorrect. The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule in the Caucasus, including Karabakh! [AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew [AR] in Russian and German settlers, who were welcomed by Azeris. How [AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in [AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland, and [AR] demanded separation from California? Non-sequitur. [AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement [AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians. That is correct. Armenian historians don't say this! [AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the [AR] fourth century. But those ancient residents had no link to and [AR] nothing in common with Armenians. Considering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith, and their utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an argument totally invalid! [AR] Azeris would have a better claim to [AR] be successors of Albania, since Azeris have for centuries inhabited, [AR] dominated, and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation. Wishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo- political advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity, Azeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing their minorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of other nationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan. [AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the [AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the [AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual [AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders. This [AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the [AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory [AR] nations, not just by Turkey. Such agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of Armenians. [AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N., the [AR] CSCE, the Commonwealth, NATO or Iran. The second key to untying the [AR] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the [AR] U.N. definition of 1974. Fine, so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian enclave? What is Azerbaijan afraid of? Perhaps the fact that the territory is the home of Armenians, the UN, would by definition, support the local population! [AR] When that is accomplished, the international community can and should [AR] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as [AR] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the [AR] former Yugoslavia. Such decisive collective international action can [AR] halt further aggression in Karabakh, and prevent the Armenian-Azeri [AR] conflict from growing and spreading. Azerbaijan's refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their own future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are actions that will address the Karabakh conflict. Viewing events in a war in isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy as an act of Allied aggression!

It can be easily inferred from the facts on the ground and from the information provided by the Hebrew press. There is one condition, though. The torrents of claptrap about "the peace process" must be totally ignored, as must Israel's official pronouncements, whole sole purpose is to distort reality. By concentrating only on the facts, it was early apparent that Labour's policies were no different from those of Shamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their more effective implementation. Likud's policies were accurately described by Ariel Sharon in an article, accompanied by a map, in Yediot Aharonot last August. The Sharon plan envisaged a division of the West Bank into seven, and the Gaza Strip into four, "autonomous" Palestinian enclaves, all of them under Israeli supervision. The total area of these enclaves amounted to about 15 per cent of the territories. The rest was to be controlled by the Israeli settlements and the highways built around the enclaves. The entire area around Jerusalem, from the outskirts of Ramallah to the boundaries of Bethlehem, has already been turned into a "Greater Jerusalem" where the Arab- inhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded by areas occupied by Israeli settlements or reserved for them. Judging from Labour's settlement policy, it may be assumed that it may content itself with a lesser number of Arab enclaves of a rather larger size than Sharon had planned. But the principle of surrounding the enclaves by settlements strategically dispersed along the highways remains unchanged. Labour plans only four enclaves in the West Bank: two in "Samaria" and two in "Judea" (i.e. north and south of Jerusalem respectively), and no more than two in the Gaza Strip. In regard to "Greater Jerusalem", Labour's policies hardly deviate from Sharon's. A saner version of Likud policy As some Israeli correspondents at once realised, Labour policies were but a saner version of Sharon's extravaganza. Last July, Gideon Eshet wrote in Yediot Aharonot that, while "barely a few months ago" Labour supported the demand to freeze all construction beyond the Green Line, "no specific decision to freeze construction in the territories has been taken". And Uzi Benziman wrote in Ha'aretz that "as far as can be judged on the basis of the internal political discussions in Jerusalem, Rabin intends to stick to Likud's ways". The two biggest enclaves envisaged by Labour are located in "Samaria". Therefore the belt of settlements around the "Trans-Samaria Highway", designed to separate those enclaves from each other, is of paramount importance. According to the latest data, the percentage of Israeli settlers in the entire West Bank population (apart from East Jerusalem) is a mere 5.5 per cent. But for the area around the "Trans-Samaria Highway", the corresponding figure is almost 20 per cent, and it is increasing steadily. The situation in the settlements of the "Efrat Block" south of Jerusalem, designed to sever the enclave around Bethlehem from the one around Hebron, is pretty much the same. The "Efrat Block" is now being connected with West Jerusalem by a highway. The project is costly in the extreme, because the highway is designed to bypass Bethlehem by a sequence of long tunnels. The final decision to build this highway was suspended until Rabin's return from his US visit in March. The subsequent decision to renew its construction can be seen as US approval for the enclaves plan as a whole. Process of impoverishment The enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady impoverishment of the Palestinians. This is well known in Israel but ignored abroad by all who should be concerned, including the PLO. In regard to the Gaza Strip, the whole process was best described by Ze'ev Shiff in Ha'aretz in March. He mentions having seen "a pamphlet issued six years ago by the Civil Administration forecasting the conditions in the Gaza Strip under Israeli rule in 2000". His analysis deserves to be quoted extensively: "We continue to steal the Strip's water, even though its quality deteriorates from year to year. We continue to steal the Strip's tiny land resources, in order to found there more and more settlements, as if we deliberately want to make the inhabitants despair, and in their despair think in termws of having nothing to lose. It is by our own doing that the Strip's workers must now spend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time as they spend working. From the military point of view, we have kept control of no more than half the Strip's area at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and resources. About a year before Moshe Arens left the defence ministry, I heard him saying that we should withdraw from the Strip come what may. His argument was that Israel sinks into the Strip ever deeper and deeper. He told me he had proposed this to Yitzhak Shamir but he rejected it." Yitzhak Rabin rejects it too. Enormous state support for the Qatif Block settlers can also be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being implemented. The Qatif Block settlements, founded by the first Rabin government of 1974-77, are intended to divide the Gaza Strip into two separate enclaves. Efraim Davidi of Davar had data showing how vital for Israeli this enterprise is. "The Qatif Block is now producing 40 per cent of Israeli tomatoes destined for export, and a substantial proportion of cut flowers." He also deals with the subsidies the settlers receive, considerably augmented by the present government. Owing to them, housing units are cheap. The present government does not spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block. "Any prospective settler will get a 95 per cent mortgage for his house on top of a grant of 18,000 shekels ($6,500)." Such data shows that Israel's plans apply whether the Palestinians of the Gaza Strip are allowed or forbidden to work in Israel. The economic motivations were explained by Danny Rubinstein in Ha'aretz in March: "From the economic viewpoint Gaza could already be sealed off hermetically and all the Strip's workers could be barred from entering Israel...Even though accurate data is hard to come by, it is indisputable that during the last two years the numbes of Gazan workers arriving daily to work in Israel has markedly decreased, from 80,000 in the mid'80s to 40,000 today. But the decrease is not only due to restrictions imposed on entering Israel from Gaza. It is also due to the drastic curtailment of demand for Gazan labour in Israel. With unemployment in Israel soaring and the construction of apartments blocks virtually halted, the workers from Gaza are no longer really needed..." Gaza's total dependence The entire economy of the Gaza Strip is totally dependent on Israel. In recent years in the Gaza Strip there has been an increase in sub-contracted work for Israeli factories, mostly footware and textiles. Thousands of small workshops, employing an average of four workers, get their raw materials or unfinished products, together with detailed working instructions, from Israeli factories. Rubinstein attributes this development to the fact that "the average wage in the Gaza Strip is merely 40 per cent of that in the West Bank, which in turn stands at half the average wage in Israel; and besides the Gazan employer does not pay any social security for his employees." If the average wage in the Gaza Strip is just a fifth of that in Israel, the profits of Israeli factories and even of Palestinian sub-contractors must be vast. They are higher still when "a Gazan sub-contractor provides labour to be performed at home, with the family's help. The livelihood of tens of thousands of Gazans depends on such sub-contracted work." Many of them are women and children, paid about ten shekels ($3.50) a day which can last 12 hours or more. There can be no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap Gazan labour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition of Rabin and other Israeli ministers to withdrawal from the Strip. Economic conditions in the Gaza Strip differ little from what was created straight after Israel's conquest [in 1967]. In this respect, one should not be deluded by the talk, nowadays fashionable, about Israeli gestures intended to "encourage economic development in the territories", As Israeli journalists point out, all permits for opening new businesses depend on a prior approval by the Shin Bet. "Behind all the professed goodwill there is no desire to solve problems, just the attitude of a good colonialist, willing to do something for the benefit of the natives, but on condition that they behave nicely, do not become rebellious, and never do anything against the interests of the metropolis, its economic interests included," wrote Michal Sela in Davar in February. The development of sub-contracted work in the Gaza Strip accords perfectly with Sela's diagnosis. Sela also shows how exactly the economic controls work. "In all branches of the economy, lobbies have been set in motion for purposes of freeing Israeli production from the threat of any Palestinian competition. The method is simplicity itself. As soon as any Israeli producer succeeds in persuading the government, or even the trade and industry minister alone, a military order is issued prohibiting the export of a given produce to Israel. If this does not suffice, a Palestinian factory may be denied a licence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse its production." Among the most active of such lobbies is the agricultural one. It has succeeded in limiting exports of Gazan vegetables (except for those grown by settlers) not only to Israel but also to Europe, where they otherwise might compete with Israeli exports. Perpetuaring apartheid Labour's goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in the territories. The same goal is shared by the US, which otherwise could not support the Labour government so firmly. In my view one of the reasons the US feels happier about supporting Labour than Likud is its greater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive. This point was brought home by Ofer Shelah in Ma'ariv, who deplored the settlers' failure which he attributed to Likud's inefficiency. he showed that the peak yearly settlement growth "occured during the term of office of the National Unity government (i.e. 1984-90) in which Rabin served throughout as the defence minister". Likud's reputation for settling the territories better than Labour is false, attributable to the many tiny settlements without strategic value founded under Shamir for symbolic reasons. To sum up: Labour's policy, unconditionally supported by the US differs from that of Likud primarily in the efficiency with which it is implemented. According to that policy the territories are to be divided into two parts. The major part is to be ruled by Israel directly, and the minor part indirectly. In my view, this racist scheme is doomed to ultimately fail, but at a horrifying price in human suffering. The sooner its true nature is recognised, the less suffering it may cause. ************************************	1

All are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly clorhing of workers. Of the 31 we saw only one policeman and two apparent national volunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians, including eight women and three small children. Two groups, apparently families, had fallen together, the children cradled in the women's arms. Several of them, including one small girl, had terrible head injuries: only her face was left. Survivors have told how they saw Armenians shooting them point blank as they lay on the ground." Anatol Lieven The Times (London), 3/3/92 Karabagh Survivors Flee to Mountains: "Geyush Gassanov, the deputy mayor of Khocaly, said that Armenian troops surrounded the town after 7 pm on Tuesday. They were accompanied by six or seven light tanks and armoured carriers. 'We thought they would just bombard the village, as they had in the past, and then retreat. But they attacked, and our defence force couldn't do anything against their tanks.' Other survivors described how they had been fired on repeatedly on their way through the mountains to safety. 'For two days we crawled most of the way to avoid gunfire,' Sukru Aslanov said. His daughter was killed in the battle for Khodjaly, and his brother and son died on the road."

Let me improve this one for you, then. For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds. The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye. Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia. Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity. x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds. Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland. ...On this occasion, we once again reiterate the unquestioned justice of the restitution of Turkish and Kurdish rights and... - We demand that the x-Soviet Armenian Government admit its responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, render reparations to the Muslim people, and return the land to its rightful owners. The recognition of the Genocide has become an issue which cannot be delayed further, and it is imperative that artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed. - We believe the time has come to demand from the the United States that it formally recognizes the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, adopts the principles of our demands and refuses to accede to Armenian pressures to the contrary. - As taxpayers of the United States, we express our vehement protest to the present U.S. Government policy of continued coddling, protection and unqualified assistance towards x-Soviet Armenia. - Our territorial demands are strictly aimed at x-Soviet Armenia's.

Page A11. FIGURE IN ADL SPY CASE ARRESTED AT S.F. AIRPORT ESPIONAGE: Former police officer is taken into custody upon arriving from Philippines, where he had fled after FBI interrogation. By Jenifer Warren, Times staff writer San Francisco -- A former San Francisco police officer who fled to the Philippines amid accusations that he funneled confidential law enforcement information to an investigator for the Anti-Defamation League was arrested at the airport here on 11 felony charges, police said Friday. Thomas J. Gerard who abruptly left the United States in October after the FBI questioned him about his activities, was apprehended Thursday night after a source in the Philippines told investigators that Gerard was returning home. Gerard, 50, was booked into San Francisco County Jail early Friday morning on eight counts of theft of government documents and one count each of computer theft, burglary and conspiracy. If convicted on all charges, Gerard could face 16 years in prison and $40,000 in fines. Bail was initially set at $250,000 after police argued that he was a flight risk, but it was later reduced to $20,000. A friend of Gerard was trying to post bail late Friday afternoon, a sheriff's spokeswoman said. Gerard returned to the United because he missed his wife and child, with whom he lived on a houseboat in Sausalito, and "wanted to have his day in court," said Police Capt. John Willett, his former boss and one of two arresting officers. Gerard, an undercover agent for the Central Intelligence Agency from 1982 to 1985, also feared that the CIA was out to kill him, Willett said. In an interview with The Times last month, Gerard threatened to disclose illegal CIA support of death squads in Central America if he was indicted and tried on the San Francisco spying charges. Gerard is a central figure in a scandal over an intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civil rights organization. Investigators allege that Gerard illegally gave criminal histories to Roy Bullock, a San Francisco art dealer who said he has been an undercover ADL intelligence operative for 40 years. Investigators said they found confidential police files in Bullock's home computer -- which contained entries on 10,000 people and 950 groups -- and in boxes in his apartment. Files have also been seized under search warrants from ADL offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles but authorities have not disclosed their contents. Gerard could not be reached for comment Friday, and his attorney, James Lassart, did not return telephone calls seeking comment. In the interview with The Times last month, however, Gerard acknowledged snooping and sharing some information with Bullock, but denied any criminal wrongdoing. Bullock and Gerard also are under investigation for selling intelligence to South Africa. ADL officials have described Bullock as a $550-a-week independent contractor and have vigorously denied knowledge of any illegal activity. On Friday, ADL lawyer Jerrold Ladar said Gerard's arrest "has nothing to do with ADL. Other than that, we have no comment on the case." Arab-American groups -- which were a main target of the spying, according to police -- applauded the arrest and pressed authorities to pursue the investigation. "We urge investigators to carry this case forward and to publicly disclose the full extent of ADL and law enforcement involvement," said James Zogby, head of the Arab American Institute in Washington. Police, meanwhile, characterized Gerard's arrest -- the first in the inquiry into the spying scandal -- as an unexpected breakthrough. A former police colleague of Gerard, Inspector Fred Mollat, visited Gerard several weeks ago and urged him to return home. "I knew he wouldn't want to live on an island on the lam forever, but we didn't think it would happen this quickly," Capt. Willett said. "This development really speeds up our timetable on the case." During his 25-year career on the police force, Gerard was a highly regarded officer known for his work in the department's intelligence division. His last assignment was on the gang task force. After FBI agents questioned Gerard last fall, he took early retirement and fled to the remote jungle island of Palawan, 300 miles south of Manila. Gerard was arrested at 8:40 p.m. as he stepped from his Philippines Airlines flight. He was traveling alone and looked tanned but haggard after his six-month hiatus, police said. "He was surprised when he saw us standing there, and got a shocked look on his face," Willett said. "Then he said, 'Hello, I'm back.'" -- Yigal Arens USC/ISI TV made me do it! arens@isi.edu	1

"[Zionists]...looked for means...to cause the tens of thousands of sulky Arabs who remained in the Galilee to flee...I gathered all the Jewish muktars, who have contact with Arabs in different villages and asked them to whisper in the ears of some Arabs that a great Jewish reinforcement has arrived in Galilee and that it is going to burn all of the villages of the Huleh. They should suggest to these Arabs, as their friends, to escape while there is still time....The tactic reached its goal....wide areas were cleaned."

"During the last 100 years our people have been in a process of building up the country and the nation, of expansion, of getting additional Jews and additional settlements in order to expand the borders here.

"To pretend that the Egyptian forces massed on our frontiers [in 1967] were in position to threaten the existence of Israel constitutes an insult not only to the intelligence of anyone capable of analyzing this sort of situation, but above all an insult to the Zahal [Israeli army]" (General Res.

Let us not shrink back when we see the hatred fermenting and filling the lives of hundreds of thousands of Arabs, who sit all around us. Let us not avert our gaze, so that our hand shall not slip. This is the fate of our generation, the choice of our life - to be prepared and armed, strong and tough - or otherwise, the sword will slip from our first, and our life will be snuffed out." (Moshe Dayan, eulogy of Roy Rutenberg at Kibbutz Nahal Oz, 1956, quoted in Uri Avneri, Israel without Zionists, Collier Books, Macmillan, New York, 1971, p.154)	1

Source: 'The Sunday Times,' 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly, written by Thomas Goltz, from Agdam, Azerbaijan.) ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES. The spiralling violence gripping the outer republics of the former Soviet Union gained new impetus yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of hundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh. Survivors reported that Armenian soldiers shot and bayoneted more than 450 Azeris, many of them women and children, who were fleeing an attack on their town. Hundreds, possibly thousands, were missing and feared dead. The attackers killed most of the soldiers and volunteers defending the women and children. They then turned their guns on the terrified refugees. The few survivors later described what happened:" That's when the real slaughter began," said Azer Hajiev, one of three soldiers to survive. "The Armenians just shot and shot. And then they came in and started carving up people with their bayonets and knives." " They were shooting, shooting, shooting", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who arrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through Armenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed in front of her. Her daughter was still missing. One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off. The survivors said 2000 others, some of whom had fled separately, were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their wounds or the cold. By late yesterday, 479 deaths had been registered at the morgue in Agdam's morgue, and 29 bodies had been buried in the cemetery. Of the seven corpses I saw awaiting burial, two were children and three were women, one shot through the chest at point blank range. Agdam hospital was a scene of carnage and terror. Doctors said they had 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep stab wounds. Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city which has a population of 150,000, destroying several buildings and killing one person. Now wait, there is more. IT'S INHUMANE TO IGNORE THIS VIOLENCE The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre: 69 year old Hatin Nine telling: -''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told me: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.'' 72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu: - ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours. While killing children and babies mercilessly they said: You are Turks, you must die.'' 28 year old Gulsum Huseyin: - ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of my eyes.'' Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming? Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region? The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British Journalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off. Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these "lies." They are saying "exaggeration." That means ''somethings'' have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu town was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's 3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach... The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word. Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre. Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print no news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.'' The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human rights violations. International reactions must be made with international cooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming to be civilized. Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where is the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals, journalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such as France who are fast to claim leadership of "human rights?" Where are you?

Still covering up the crimes of your fascist Armenian grandparents and Nazi Armenian parents? Not a chance. As early as 1934, K. S. Papazian asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians 'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1] At that time, he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would actively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in World War II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of the Muslim population of Eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideological tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1936, for example, O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted in the 'Hairenik Weekly:' "The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race. On the other hand, Russia is comparatively weak because she is bereft of social sanctities."[2] [1] K. S. Papazian, 'Patriotism Perverted,' (Boston, Baikar Press 1934), Preface. [2] 'Hairenik Weekly,' Friday, April 10, 1936, 'The Race is our Refuge' by O. Zarmooni. In April 1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian Paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku. Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the creation of an Armenian SS formation in order "to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the spirit of the Nazi ideas." He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish homeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language radio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2] [1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106. [2] Enno Meyer, A. J. Berkian, 'Zwischen Rhein und Arax, 900 Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen,' (Heinz Holzberg Verlag-Oldenburg 1988), pp. 124 and 129. The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored by General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any official position. His views were represented by his men in the respective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942. Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after a long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to Berlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not 'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.

Hope he/she doesnt mind. By Lance Gay, Scripps-Howard News Service SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- In this land of historic hatreds, a tiny Jewish community is braving Serbian shells to repay a 50-year-old debt to Muslims who saved Jews from the Holocaust. Ivica Ceresnjes, president of the Jewish Community of Sarajevo, says he and about 1,000 other Jews chose to remain in Sarajevo, rather than leave for Israel, to keep a feeding center in the medieval old town district running. Ceresnjes said that was partly in gratitude to the Muslims who hid Jews during the Nazi occupation and partly to keep intact the centuries-old presence of Jews living in Sarajevo. ``Some with guns are defending Bosnia, but I fight in Bosnia by keeping people alive,'' Ceresnjes said. As a student of Balkan history, Ceresnjes said he saw this war coming and had ready plans to evacuate children and the elderly. A year before the war erupted here last April, Ceresnjes said the Jewish center began stockpiling supplies, ensuring everyone had passports and arranging for places in Israel and Europe for the evacuees. They were so well prepared, he said, that only five days after the shooting began the first plane left. Of about 2,000 Jews in Bosnia- Herzegovina, he estimates half have left. Many of those who stayed behind work in Sarajevo's downtown synagogue, which has been turned into a wartime feeding center that has so far given away 380,000 meals. The center, which has been shelled several times along with most of Sarajevo, also runs a radio station, mail center and distributes food packages sent by Jewish organizations around the world. While Muslims and Jews are fighting each other in the Mideast, Jews here say there's a long tradition of cooperation, inter-marriage and tolerance between the two communities in Sarajevo that goes back to centuries of Turkish occupation. Sarajevo's Jews trace their ancestry back to their expulsion from Roman Catholic Spain in 1492. The community numbered more than 14,000 before World War II. But only 10% survived the Holocaust -- which was carried out by the pro-Nazi Croatian Ustache in Yugoslavia. Many of the survivors were hidden by Muslim families in Mostar. -- Sharon Machlis Gartenberg Framingham, MA USA e-mail: sharon@world.std.com ---------------------------------------- Zafar. tippu hassan	1

In Bosnia, "Muslim" is not merely a religious category, but an ethnic one as well. Actually, here are the two contradictory arguments made by people on this subject: (1) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality, and Bosnian Muslims are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith. (2) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel themselves to be Croats nor Serbs. In 1968, argument (2) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid, and (1) was soundly rejected. The reasons are pragmatic: even if Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under Turkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality. In fact, although Bosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national allegiance, most of them feel they have a separate cultural and historic identity. So, arguments like "yes, but your ancestors were Croats or Serbs" carry very little weight. Regardless of what their ancestors might have been, as long as Bosnian Muslims feel that they are a separate national group, that ends the debate. What outsiders say is simply not relevant. >the way the western press use the word 'muslim' in this Bosnian debacle has >kept me wondering when the meaning of muslim/moslem i knew from childhood was >changed in the dictionary. this is just a question. no flames intended! In the case of former Yugoslavia, the date is 1971, when "Muslim nationality" appeared as a census category for the first time. This was the result of a sequence of decisions over the past decade, from recognizing "Bosniaks" as an ethnic group (1961) to February 1968 resolution (in B-H) declaring that Muslims are a separate nation, to formal endorsement of this in January 1969, and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of "Muslim nationality" choice in census forms. For comparison, in 1948 census there were three national categories available to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina: Serb-Muslims: 71,991 Croat-Muslims: 25,295 Muslims, ethnically undeclared: 788,403 This clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own nationality. Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat nationality. Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have consistently opted for a third category: in 1948 they chose "undeclared", in 1953 they chose "Yugoslavs", in 1961 both "Yugoslavs" and "Bosniak ethnic group", and in 1971, 1981 and 1991 they chose "Muslim nationality". Perhaps the term "Bosnian Muslim nationality" is too confusing for the rest of the world. But, in the present context, we ARE talking about Muslims as nationality; not as a religous group within some separate national identity. The reasons are mostly historical and cultural. Religion plays a smaller role, as a part of culture in general, because the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism. Political fanaticism, yes; religious fanaticism, no. Group security and survival dominate people's thinking; not fine points of theology. In fact, Bosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime as it is known for terrible carnage in wartime. Sincerely, -Josip	1

I am speaking from experience when I say that those who remained in Ethiopia are Christians. I know that there have previously been things published in the press by interesting parties, and there is no connection between them and reality." "What interested parties ?" "Ethiopian immigrants who want their Christian relatives to come here." "What to you recommend that Ethiopian children in Israel do, when their parents and the rest of their relatives remain in Ethiopia ?" "I ask if it is the job of the State of Israel to bring in the 40 relatives who stayed in Ethiopia. Well, my answer is that it is not.

The clear aim was to break the Arab morale and raise somewhat the morale of the Jewish commu- nity in Jerusalem, which had been hit hard time after time, especially recenctly by the desecration of Jewish bodies which fell into Arab hands" Yehuda Lapidot, Jabotinsky Archives testimony as quoted by Yisrael Segal in "The Deir Yassin File", published by Koteret Rashit 19th January 1983 So it wasn't like the Holocaust more like Lidice - a warning, a punishment. Collective and inflicted on unarmed innocents just not as through. "When it comes to prisoners, old people and children, there were differences of opinion, but the majority was for liquidation of all the men in the village and any other force that opposed us, whether it be old people, women or children Benzion Cohen Commander of the attack on Deir Yassin, (J.A.T.) Let me put in some words here a. premeditated b. murder What do you say about the eyewitness testimony of the man in command? "We had prisoners and before the retreat we decided to liquidate them. We also liquidated the wounded, as anyway we could not give them first aid. In one place about eighty Arab prisoners were killed after some of them had opened fire and killed one of the people who came to give them first aid. Arabs who dressed up as Arab women were also found, and so they started to shoot the women also who did not hurry to the area where the prisoners were concentrated" (J.A.T.) Shooting prisoners, the wounded, as a warning to hurry? Sounds VERY familiar to me, how about you? Heard of other people other places doing these things? "In one case - the Zahran family - only one out of twenty five survived. In another house they caught the sixteen year old son Fuad. His mother was holding him. They killed him with a knife. The mother spent twenty years after that in a mental hospital. A young woman and her two year old baby were shot in the street. Their bodies were left there. They moved to the centre of the village and started to kill everybody they saw or heard, as soon as anybody opened his door. They were using bombs [grenades], machine-guns, submachine-guns. My cousin escaped with bullet-holes in his clothes. One of the officers put his machinegun through a window and started shooting outwards, killing everybody who moved. They killed my uncle, Ali Hassan Zeidan, and my aunt Fatima. She heard him call 'help me'. She ran to him and they killed her. Another neighbour Haj Yarah, heard some voices and came out. They killed him too. His son Muhammad, who was about seventeen, heard his father call him and went to the same place. They killed him. His mother heard her son cry for help. She ran out and they killed her. That was near my house. I saw this" Muhammad Arif Sammour Funny how 'Myths and Facts' does not see fit to include this too - after all if he is reliable enough to report casualties why not the actual events? What do you say about this Harry? "In the exchange that followed four men were killed and a dozen were wounded.. ..by noon time the battle was over and the shooting had ceased. Although there was a calm, the village had not yet surrendered. The Irgun and Lehi men came out of hiding and began to 'clean' the houses. They shot whoever they saw, women and children included, the commanders did not try and stop the massacre...I pleaded with the commander to order his men to cease fire, but to no avail. In the meantime twenty five Arabs had been loaded on a truck and driven through Mahane-Yehuda and Zichron Yosef.

This is a critical point in the history of world and we can make a change otherwise things will not change there in Bosnia.. Rapes/killings/ethnic cleansing will go on as a norm in the days to follow. The UN will get to the towns after the fall of thousands of inocent civilians (like in Zapa just the past weekend!). It happened to the Jews in 1940's, it's happening to the muslims today and who will be the next victim?? Since the Europeans want to remain indifferent in this issue, time has come for US to take a leadership role to stop these crimes against humanity. Time is now and this is for real folks, the people of New England Bosnian Relief Committee seriously believe that Clinton's Adminstration will stop supporting the Bosnian cause without sustained public pressure. I just called Democaratic Sen. John Kerry's office and they are saying that he (the senator) is waiting for president to take a decision, means that he will wait and join the band-wagon later if it ever moves! Please don't rely on others to take part in this demonstration -You as an individual will make a big difference. Bring your families too, not only you will help a great cause but also it will be fun for all. I know of several families from Massachusetts who are travelling friday night to participate there. Contact the local Islamic center or Bosnia relief agency if you want to travel by pre-arranged busses. The best option for students is to rent-a-car and car-pool. Please, spread the word around...

We have compiled a list of suggestions to guide you. If you are interested in pursuing one or more of these suggested activities, the Educational Network can aid you by /coordinating/ the initial contacts, /following up/, and /providing any other support/ you may need. 1. Link your teachers' union with a teachers' union here --- linkage should be based on a shared pedagogical enterprise. 2. Get your union to actively support the right of Palestinian teachers in the Occupied Territories to form unions: a. through the International Labor Organization (if your union is a member) b. contacting other international unions which have supported our right to form a union -- we can supply names and addresses. 3. Establish a SCHOLARSHIP FUND for one or more Palestinian students to study at a Palestinian university or school -- or establish a scholarship fund for a Palestinian student or teacher to study at a university abroad. 4. Reproduce and publish information about Palestinian education: a. for your union membership; b. for the outside community. The Educational Network can supply up-to-date information and statistics. 5. Send delegations of teachers to visit the Occupied Territories during periods when our schools are in session. The Network can arrange an itinerary, make hotel and local travel arrangements, and provide a guide for the visit. 6. Sponsor Palestinian teachers to visit your city for an educational tour: a. to see schools and speak with educators in order to learn about progressive pedagogical ideas and experiences; b. to speak about the conditions of Palestinian education. The Network will coordinate from Palestine. 7. Establish teacher-exchange programs for one year in which a Palestinian teacher from a private school teaches at a public or private school abroad while a teacher from that school spends a year in a Palestinian private school. 8. Send an experienced educator to the Occupied Territories to give workshops (all-day workshops or two- day workshops) on innovative teaching techniques. The Network will pay for the person's food, lodging, and travel while in Palestine, and will serve as guide. 9. Set up a pen-pal program with a Palestinian school in either English or French. 10. Set up a sister-school program with a Palestinian school which would actively involve teachers as well as students at both schools -- a great tool for building international understanding and mutual sensitivity. 11. Keep the Educational Network informed about important educational conferences so that we can send a Palestinian teacher to attend. 12. Send to the Educational Network articles or other writings or books dealing with innovative approaches and ideas in the field of education so that we can then disseminate the information locally. 13. Support an educational development project in the Occupied Territories.	1

Thanks for posting the references. I do not normally read t.p.m., and I posted my request for references because Jim's article was cross-posted to soc.culture.jewish. Allegations of Jewish disrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions are one of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture, and rumors of church and Host desacration probably caused more pogroms than blood libel. The stereotypes that pervade our culture create cognitive illusions that reify those stereotypes. Therefore any claim that appears to reify a stereotype should be treated by decent people with utmost suspicion until and unless documented. If such a claim is cross-posted to a news group in which it has not been documented before, such as s.c.j, a reference should be given the first time it appears. Now that the claim has been documented, I regard the whole episode as disgusting and shameful. Especially so because the official who failed to provide proper temporary facilities for the evicted Jordanians was probably Jewish, and as a Jew I know that he should have known better.

All Muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy Iraq, not to "Liberate Kuwait", The people who were killed by the invasion are more (many many more), than the ones that were killed by the Iraqis in their smaller invasion. I lived in the west, and I have seen how your media prepared you (helpless naive Americans) for a war against Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that led to the invasion, as the CIA correctly predicted (and pretended to be surprised not to know). It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid. What would I have done: Most Muslims would choose 300 dead Kuwaitis over 200,000 dead Iraqis and 1000 dead Kuwaitis. The first case would happen if no western intervention happened, and the second case was a direct or indirect result of western envolvement. Human rights in Kuwait? what about human rights in Iraq? why the west gave Saddam a green light to slaughter his own people? I will give my reason: because the rich Kuwaitis do not mind to be your salves, so they deserve some democracy, but Iraqis might not, so they don't. As simple as that, whether or not you want to admit it. >I think that it is a very good idea to not have governments have an >official religion (de facto or de jure), because with human nature >like it is, the ambitious and not the pious will always be the >ones who rise to power.

Not necessarily the best solution, my view of an Islamic state (and that of Turabi that your media made you hate) includes all the benefits of a secular state minus the injustices. Did you ever read a book by Rashid Al-Ghannoushi (Tunisia), Hassan Turabi (Sudan)? You only know about them from your Self-censured, self-controlled media. If they make this kind of campaign against such a moderate thinker as Turabi is, and keep quite about such an extremist Muslim scholar as Bin Bez of Saudi Arabia is, it just does not encourage any moderation in our ARab world. >You make it sound like these guys are angels, Ilyess. (In your >clarinet posting you edited out some stuff; was it the following???) No it was not that, it was just some irrelevent stuff that I took out to go around the copyright (;-)) I ceased to take the Newyork times seriously. In issues concerning Islam it has become one of the biggest enemies (although less than the other NewYork daily since Mortimer took it over). It lies, selects facts that fits its agenda and even prints racist and open anti-Muslim editorials. What they claimed in that articles is a bunch of lies because while the selected facts are true about some of those persons, the other members are actually defence lawyers and University science professors who wanted to fight corruption, uncover atrocities against opposition activists and Shia minority, and generally increase awareness about the rights of all citizens. The only thing that is common between those people is their concern for the deterioration of human rights since the Saudi clan took a green light from AMerica (after the gulf) to do whatever is necessary to stay in power. Do you know that ALL OF THE SAUDI ULEMA have been taught the same things? the ones in the official Iftaa are as conservative as the ones that are opposing it. SOme of the members of the human rights committe are MORE PRO-WOMEN and wanted to defend them, and that is precisely one reason that Bin Bez's Fatwah implied for the "Illegality " of this committee and for his claim that it represents "Outside interests" There is a human rights issue in Saudi ARabia, and YOU and NY times chose to ignore the main issue and select some of the members of that committee and actually defend the actions done against them (including banning them from their Jobs.

Excerpt. EACH ONE AND HIS OWN NEVO* (* A reference to General Azri'el Nevo, Shamir's Military Secretary. Irrelevant to this excerpt.) By Nahum Barne'a . . . In mid '91 SHABAK found itself in the center of another storm [...]. A year and a half earlier, Khaled Sheikh Ali, 27, a member of the Islamic Jihad, died at the SHABAK installation in Gaza prison. The two SHABAK interrogators who were responsible for his death were put on trial. In September '91 the Supreme Court rejected their appeal and sentenced them to 6 months in prison. As far as is known, this was the first time in Israel's history that SHABAK operatives were sent to prison. The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the warning by the director of SHABAK that the sentence will be detrimental the effectiveness of other interrogators. [...] The judges in the case were [...] Barak, Goldberg, and Matza. When they realized that they were on their own, the interrogators agreed to talk. Deputy State Attorney Rachel Sukkar[sp?] was placed in charge of investigating the affair. She [...] questioned the directors of all SHABAK divisions. She investigated only the matter of the death in Gaza prison. She discovered that not only torture, but also "the culture of lies", which Judge Landau had described in his report of two years before, were still very much in existence. Nothing had changed. The report was classified and was seen by only some ten people, among them the Prime Minister, the people at the top of the judicial system and Judge Landau. The director of SHABAK claimed that he did not know. After all, they were dealing only with a single jail and with low ranking people. The system bit the bullet and accepted the explanation. One of SHABAK's high-ranking officials was transfered from his very high position to a less high position. . . . ["The culture of lies" referred to above is the SHABAK interrogators' policy of lying in court when denying detainees claims that they were tortured in the course of interrogation. The Landau commission sought to correct this problem by legalizing a list of torture methods -- thus eliminating the fear that a detainee might be released if those methods were used to extract a confession. The fact that the need to lie still persists would seem to indicate that SHABAK is not sticking to the "approved" torture methods. -- Yigal] -- Yigal Arens USC/ISI TV made me do it! arens@isi.edu	1

They issued a statement after a three-day Gulf Cooperation Council summit saying Iran had to show proof of its good neighbourly intentions by rescinding measures that "rocked Gulf stability and security." The leaders avoided the anti-Iranian rhetoric of recent statements by Egypt, which engineered a last minute settlement of a border row between Saudi Arabia and Qatar that allowed all members to attend the summit. Egypt said its fears about Iranian intentions in the region and Tehran's alleged encouragement of Moslem fundamentalist unrest were largely behind President Hosni Mubarak's mediation. The GCC statement stressed that developing relations between the Gulf Arab states and Iran "is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take in line with its commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of the sovreignty and territorial integrity of the region's states." It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which it shares with the United Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the Greater and Lesser Tumbs islands. Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a small garrison it established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah. It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the island for the UAE government. But diplomats say it continues to exercise its authority over the whole island, which the UAE sess as as virtual annexation. The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the UAE has since the Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part of a general settlement. The GCC leaders called on the U.N. to maintain sanctions against Iraq for not fully implementing Security Council resolutions following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. They endorsed once again the "Damascus Declaration," a pact signed with Egypt and Syria after their troops took part in the U.S. led alliance that drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. But delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of a fund they announced they would create at their last summit in Kuwait last year which would have helped Egypt's and Syria's economic development programme. They said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown of contributions from each state although the total amount had been scaled down to $6 billion from the $10 billion agreed last year. The fact that the leaders of all GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar -- attended the summit was seen as a major achievement although their unity was only maintained with outside help. Most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slow progress of the conservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for the region that boasts the bulk of global oil and gas reserves. The leaders were unable to choose between two proposals. One put forward by a summit committee headed by Oman's Sultan Qaboos to create a 100,000-man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any member against external aggression, such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Another was a Saudi-supported plan to expand the existing 10,000-man "Peninsula Shield" force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and is commanded by a Saudi general. Little headway was made on plans for a reginal common market although the summit called for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year's summit due to be held in Saudi Arabia next December. REUTER YA DYA DJG RTw 12/23 0835 GULF LEADERS END SUMMIT ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter - Gulf Arab states ended a three-day annual summit on Wednesday with an appeal to Iran to end its occupation of three strategic Gulf islands as a condition for restoring friendly ties across the Gulf. A joint statement issued after the summit, marked by relief over the settlement of a row between two Gulf Cooperation Council members, also called for continued U.N. sanctions against Iraq. It said Baghdad had failed to implement key Security Council decisions following the expulsion of its troops from Kuwait early last year. The summit broke no new ground on steps to achieve a Gulf common market, but called on officials to present a plan for common external tarrifs for all six members to the next summit which will be held in Saudi Arabia in December 1993. The statement stressed that developing relations between the Gulf Arab states and Iran "is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take in line with its commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of the sovreignty and territorial integrity of the region's states." It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which it shares with the United Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the smaller islands, the Greater and Lesser Tumbs. It expressed deep regret and extreme concern for the unjustified Iranian measures which contradict a proclaimed wish to develop relations and called on Iran to rescind those measures and end the occupation which it said was "shaking peace and stability in the area." Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a small garrison it established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah. It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the island for the UAE government but diplomats in the region say that its security forces continue to exercise their authority over the whole island. The UAE has seen this as virtual annexation. The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the UAE has since the Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part of a general settlement. REUTER YA DYA DJG RTw 12/26 1441 IRAN HINTS IT READY TO GO TO WAR OVER ISLANDS (Eds: updates with SNSC statement) NICOSIA, Dec 26, Reuter - Iran told its Gulf Arab neighbours on Saturday it was ready to defend militarily three disputed islands, reminding them of its eight-year war with Iraq. "Our eight-year defence (in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war) has proved to the world that our brave nation will never hesitate to defend the sovereignty and safeguard the territorial integrity of Iran," Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) said. A meeting of the heads of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council voiced full support on Wednesday for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iran over the Gulf islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb. The move has triggered strong Iranian criticism and warnings. Besides the UAE, the GCC also groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who chaired the SNSC's meeting on Saturday, said during his Friday prayer sermon at Tehran University: "Iran is surely stronger than the likes of you. To reach these islands one has to cross a sea of blood." The SNSC, quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA received in Cyprus, also criticised the GCC and described its support of the UAE as "irresponsible." "No country will ever be able to covet even an inch of Iranian soil," said the SNSC. Earlier on Saturday, the English language Tehran Times, believed to be close to the Foreign Ministry, said the UAE should be aware that Iran's self-restraint had certain limits. It dismissed a UAE claim to the islands as unfounded and said a 1971 agreement to share Abu Musa with the UAE emirate of Sharjah still applied. "The idea of Abu Dhabi officials that Tehran would always refrain from responding to the blows inflicted by them was "childish," Tehran Times said. IRNA said the newspaper was commenting on the GCC statement which urged Iran to reverse what it says is the annexation of Abu Musa island and to pull out of the two other islands. Iran says the islands near the entrance to the Gulf have historically belonged to it. The dispute flared this year after Iran tightened its control over Abu Musa. REUTER AF JCH RTw 12/28 1011 TEHRAN PAPER WANTS IRAN REVIVE CLAIM TO BAHRAIN TEHRAN, Dec 28, Reuter - Radical Iranian newspapers, angered by Gulf Arab claims to three disputed islands, are hitting back with demands that Tehran revive its claim to Bahrain and consider improving ties with Iraq. President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and senior officials strongly condemned a statement last week by leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) backing the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iran over the Gulf islands. But the newspapers Salam and Jomhuri Eslami demanded that Tehran go further than restating its resolve to defend its sovereignty over the islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb. "It is not very clear why the Sheikh of Bahrain has joined the others," Jomhuri Eslami said. The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. "If historical records are to be the criterion, the sheikh of Bahrain should go about his own business and the rule of Iranian people in Bahrain, which belonged to Iran until 1970, should be re-established," the paper said. "It is fitting for the foreign ministry to raise the question of Iran's sovereignty over Bahrain...and start a serious and effective drive to end the separation of Bahrain from Iran," it added. The late Shah of Iran relinquished Iran's claim to Bahrain in 1970, a year before the island became an independent state. Iranian leaders since the 1979 Islamic revolution have carefully avoided raising the Bahrain issue although it is occasionally brought up in the press during periods of tension with conservative Arab states across the Gulf. Salam newspaper said the GCC stand showed that the policy of appeasing pro-Western Gulf Arab rulers had backfired. "No matter how much you smile at sheikhs on the southern coast of the Persian Gulf, it is the United States and the West which speak the last word," it said. "They (the sheikhs) are nobody," Salam said, adding that Iran should revise its policy towards its neighbours, especially its former war enemy Iraq. "Disregarding the logical potential of expanding ties with Iraq...and going along with some Saudi-backed trends among the Iraqi opposition have played a role in the formation of the current situation," the paper said. Ties between Iran and Iraq, which fought a war from 1980 to 1988, improved briefly after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. But Tehran, which denounced the invasion and remained neutral in the ensuing war, again called for President Saddam Hussein's overthrow when he suppressed a Shi'ite Moslem revolt which swept southern Iraq after his 1991 defeat in Kuwait.

Igor and I had thought that if it was a girl we would call her Raisa, after my mother-in-law, and if it was a boy, we'd call him Arsen, after Igor's grandfather. I had a girl, and I, without Igor, named her Raisa, in honor of her dead grandmother. Our family and the Melkumians had been neighbors since 1965. Igor and I grew up together, we were friends from childhood on. We got engaged when I was 16. In 1981, when I was 18, we were married. Two children were born to us in Sumgait. My daughter is now 6 years old, her name is Kristina, and my son, Seryozha, is four and a half. First I shall tell what happened on February 27. That day on my way home from work I passed Lenin Square, where about 1,500 people had gathered. There were Komsomol members there, and Pioneers [Children's organization], and there were both Party members and non-Party people there as well. All of them were shouting, "There's no room for Christians here!" and "When we finish with the Armenians, we'll go after the Russians!" And some even cried Out, "Death to the Armenians!" Absurd rumors had been circulating about town. I became frightened. I came home, breathless, and told about everything I had seen downtown. My family couldn't believe it. My father-in-law Sogomon Markovich Melkumian, wasn't home, he was at an Azerbaijani wedding. By eight o'clock he returned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was smashed with a rock. He got out of the car but there was no one there. Well I was telling him everything, too, and he said, "What, is there no longer any government?" That same day Igor said, "Papa, something terrible is happening in the city." And he said, "We'll stay at home, no one will drive us from our own home." The day passed. On February 28, that was Sunday, we didn't go out. We called our relatives and asked them all kinds of questions, and they all said the same thing. Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an Armenian from the neighboring building. Ira, my brother-in-law's wife, and I called the police: they're wrecking a car, help. We called and called, and nonetheless they didn't come and they didn't do anything. On February 29, on Monday, even though there were troops in the city, we were afraid to go to work. I called the school: I had the keys to the classroom. I told the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys, I wouldn't be coming in. He agreed, and even said, "Fine, don't come in, we understand what's going on in town, don't come in." Before that, on the 28th, the Ambartsumian family came over. They came to my father-in-law and said, "Uncle Sergey, they broke our windows, bad things are happening in town." Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said, "With my own eyes I saw them chasing naked girls through the streets. I don't know," he said, "we should leave town." Well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we should go, thinking we'd go to our dacha. We got a couple of bags together, clothes, food, the bare essentials. And then somewhere around 4:45 the building manager came by and said, "Uncle Sergey, the situation in town is bad, don't go out." My father even opened up to him and said, "Maybe we'll drive to the dacha, it'll be safer there." "No," he said, "it'll be worse there, you'll be safer at home." He said don't be afraid, if something happens I'll send people to save you. After he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our courtyard. All of us were at home at the time: Igor and I and our two children, Ira and Edik and their daughter, my sister-in-law Ira, and my mother-and father-in-law. And the Ambartsumian family, there were three of them, Uncle Misha, Zhasmen, and their daughter Marina. Now when they started breaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us, "Go in that room and close the door. Close the door and calm the children so they won't hear that there's anyone home." The children started crying. Suddenly Ira, my brother-in-law's wife, suggested, "Let's run out onto the balcony." We -- the two daughters-in-law and the children, and Zhasmen and Marina -- raced out onto the balcony. My sister-in-law and my mother-in-law ran in and said, "Quick, over to the other balcony, or they'll kill you all." We lived on the second floor. We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor's. At first we couldn't manage it. The balcony looked onto the street. At that time people were coming home from work, and many just stood there, watching. I pleaded and begged: "Please, call someone, have someone come!" I even started shouting. "I'll throw down the children, I'll throw them down, you catch them and take them somewhere, so at least the children will survive." Either they were afraid or . . . I don't know what. They looked as though they were watching a movie. Some of them started throwing stones at us. I'll say it again, these weren't the bandits, these were people from the other part of the building and from our entryway, they were just regular people, passersby. A bus even stopped. I remember a man's voice saying the Armenians were climbing over to the other balcony. Ira, my sister-in-law, helped us get the children over there. I was pregnant, about seven months pregnant. No, it wasn't yet seven, it was six and a half. I climbed over too. I think Zhasmen went first; you know, I just don't remember it all that well. Zhasmen went first, I think, and Edik's wife Ira and I had the children, and they were all screaming and crying. My Kristina said, "Mamma, don't throw us over the balcony, we're afraid!" Lilia was crying, and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too. Kristina didn't even want to climb over. She shouted, "I'm staying with Grandmother, I'm staying with Grandma!" She loved her grandma, more than she loved me. And my mother-in-law shouted, "Oh no, Kristina's still there, she's still there, save Kristina, too!" Ira helped us climb over, with Kristina coming last. Ira helped us and went back inside. We started pounding on the neighbor's balcony door. I pounded with my fist, Sevil, open the door, open it, please!" She didn't open it. "No, go away, go anywhere, go, I'm not opening the door." She was our neighbor, we were friends, we never refused her anything, ever! And apparently she thought we were going to break the windows, and she opened the door. She opened it and said, "Karina, Karina, go away, go anywhere, just don't stay here, they'll kill us, too, because of you." I begged, "Please, at least take the children, we'll leave, we'll go back." "No," she said, "you have to leave." Her sons ran in, one had a knife. Sevil's brother, he's around 18, shouted at us: "Get out of here, leave, I'll kill you with this knife!" I became terrified, I took the children and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs. I went down and heard a loudspeaker. It was in the courtyard "The Armenians must be killed, they've taken all the best places, all the best apartments!" One of them said, "Let the Armenian blood flow, none of them should survive!" When I heard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors. No one opened their door for me! Not on the third floor, or the fourth. I couldn't see Zhasmen any longer. Ira came upstairs later. I even thought that they had let her stay, that they would save her. My head was spinning. They were killing my family, and here I was in the next entryway with two children. Seryozha was four, and Kristina was five and a half. They were crying, "Mamma, we're scared!" They were so frightened that I didn't even know how to calm them, should I try to calm them or myself? It was awful. But on the third floor a man did open his door. I asked, "Open up, let me inside!" He opened the door slightly and said, "No!" "No" and that was it! He said it so sternly: "No!" I went up to the fifth floor. I pounded my fists on the door with all my might. He opened up, the man of the house, and stood there, looking at me. I was ready to get down on my knees. I almost did get down on my knees. "Please, I beg of you, at least take the children." He wasn't an Azerbaijani, he was a Lezgin. I don't even know how, but he let me inside. And when I went in, Zhasmen was already there. Two minutes hadn't passed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs. Lilia was crying. He didn't want to open the door. And again I started pleading, "Please, open the door, it's our Ira and Lilia! Open the door!" And he said, "No, I'm afraid." I said again and again, "Please, open the door, please!" He looked at me. He looked at me for a long time and then opened the door after all. Ira came in with Lilia. We threw ourselves into each other's arms, crying. Then the man locked us into the bathroom. We sat there for a long time. Through the door he told us, "Calm the children, and calm yourselves down, too." Calm down? This man was hiding us, but what of our family? When I was still in our apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive. I said, "Igor, Edik, let's say farewell." And Edik turned around and looked at me as if to say, is that some kind of joke? All the same I thought they would kill all of us. Igor looked at me, too . . . But it was already too late! They started pounding on the door, Igor was standing next to the door. Before that he had told us, "Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight." He thought we were in the room. But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them: "Edik, Igor, let's say farewell." Igor didn't think we could climb over to the other balcony. And we did get over there, and I myself can't believe we were able to save ourselves. Igor put on a helmet, and Edik had his coat on, and he put on a fur hat. All the men--Igor, Edik, their father, and Misha Ambartsumian--they all stood next to the door. They thought they would pound on it a while and leave. But from the other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani: "Open the door!" We were all silent, waiting. Someone outside the door said, "They're home, they're in there, break down the door!" And I remember my father-in-law whispering, "They're going to break it down now, it's coming down now . . . " He had something in his hands, I think it was a knife: if they got in, we were going to defend ourselves. In the hall near the door there were two metal chair legs. From outside the door they said, "We're counting to five, open up!" But we were all quiet, we didn't answer them. We made like no one was home. We figured they'd leave, they'd get tired and leave. My father-in-law had said, "It's not possible they'd come into my home. How can that be? Everyone knows us, all of Sumgait knows our family, we are on good terms with everyone." And indeed a day did not pass that there wasn't an Azerbaijani guest at our table. We had a nice dacha, everyone would get together there often, Azerbaijanis liked being with us there too. But now we had to save ourselves, we had to flee from our own home. Ira, I remember, said, "I'm not leaving here, my brothers and my parents are here, I'm going to fight alongside them." That's just what she said. She picked up a knife and said, "If they open the door and come into the apartment then I'm going to fight alongside my family, I'm not going anywhere." We were at Sevil's when they broke into our apartment. We heard fighting and shouting. The noise was terrible. And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor at the Lezgin's apartment, you could hear everything up there, too. Even Ira's voice. I remember her calling her mother several times. She called her for a long time . . . I started pounding on the door in the bathroom: "Open the door, what are they doing to Ira, who's shouting, that's Ira shouting, that's her voice!" But the Lezgin said, "It's nothing, calm down, no, it's not in your apartment." He was lying to me so I'd calm down. Two hours went by and the Lezgin opened the door and said, "Karina, Igor got away, calm down. He ran away." He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes. They killed him outside, next to the building. While we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human terror. The way Ira shouted! She shouted, "Save me, Mamma, save me! . . . Mamma, Mamma!" She repeated it several times. There was a wild din. There were very many people there, all of them shouting, all of them bellowing, howling, whistling--you just can't imagine what was going on, what the roar was like. Apparently, after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway where we were hiding and came upstairs, all the way up to the fifth floor. I don't know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us in particular, but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed over the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters-in-law were climbing over the balconies. And after we heard Ira we heard them coming up the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors. I thought those were our last moments, and started saying good-bye to my children, kissing them. They were sleeping. I woke them up: "Kristina! Seryozha, wake up!" And I tell Ira: "Ira, if something happens, we'll throw ourselves off the balcony." We were on the fifth floor. Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door too, because later he said, "I opened the door and told them there were no Armenians inside." And after they all left our neighbor went out on the balcony himself to see: they were gone. We weren't friends with those Lezgin neighbors, we only knew each other from the building. But the people we were friends with wouldn't even consider hiding us. The Lezgin let us out of the bathroom. They had a candle burning. He said, "Karina, there're no lights on in our block." The whole block was dark, the whole block! It's a huge block, too. The Lezgin said, "I'm afraid to keep you until morning, I'm afraid of the neighbors, they might kill me for saving you." I said, "What are you saying, we'll leave now. But we can't just leave with the children in the middle of the night. Give us time to find somewhere else to hide." He said, "Well OK, go look." I asked Ira, "Ira, do you want to go?" Ira said, "No, I'll stay with the children, Karina." I said, "Fine, then I'll go." Zhasmen and I went downstairs together. It was very dark. No one was in the courtyard. It was dark, pitch black. l was afraid to go out at after seven, Igor always met me after work and accompanied me home, I never went out alone. And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after a slaughter like that, too. It was probably after eleven. Later I called the boarding school and my director answered. He said, "Karina, where are you?" I didn't know, I was calling from a public phone outside and didn't know where I was. I got confused and hung up the receiver. From him I only found out what time it was, I asked him, "What time is it?" He said 11:20, I think, but I don't really remember. So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the courtyard. I look and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment. And there was the smell of something burnt. I became horrified. I looked at the corpse for a long time. It was either Ira or Edik. I only saw one of them, Zhasmen grabbed my hand and squeezed it: "Hurry up, let's go . . . Hurry up, come on, what are you turning around for?" I turned around and saw a large truck, it must have belonged to the bandits, because they came to kill us in a truck like that. We lived in the third entryway, and that truck was next to the fourth. We walked quickly, holding hands. I thought, if I go to the police then they'll put me away. I couldn't count on them. Before I reached the police station I saw a military vehicle. We went over and I said, "Soldier, in Block 41, I don't know if they've killed people or injured them--we need to save them!" And he said, "Go to the police station and tell them everything." I said, "I'm afraid to go there, I'm afraid of them." He said, "Don't be afraid." We went to the police and they wrote down the address, and the military vehicle went to our building. I didn't go with them, they left me at the police station. I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that they'd rescue them, too. I didn't know where they were or what had happened to them. After a while they brought my children and Ira and Lilia. First they took us to the KGB, that was at two or three in the morning. Then around five they took us to the City Party Committee, and there were very many people there, very many. I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress. Seryozha was only wearing a shirt, and Kristina had a little dress on. No coat, no boots, nothing! And we sat there for three whole days in the City Party Committee. The Lezgin had told me that Igor escaped. And I thought that he was probably alive. But then after two and a half days, they took us, the Armenians of Sumgait, to Nasosny. On March 6 some people from the Central Committee came and told us, "Karina, Ira, we need you, come with us to the City Party Committee." My Mamma had come to Nasosny, and she had been looking for me for six days. Mama, my brothers, and my uncle. We went to the City Party Committee and waited there in the courtyard. I was wearing nothing but a dress, and Ira had only a dress on as well. There was a strong wind on March 6. An hour went by. And then one of the functionaries told us, "Karina, Ira, gather your courage. Would you like to go to the burial?" I said, "What, did they really kill all of them?!" He said, "Let's look." He had a long list, and he started reading them off: Igor Melkumian, my husband, Eduard Melkumian, my brother-in- law, Irina Melkumian, my sister-in-law, Sogomon Melkumian, my father-in-law, and Raisa Melkumian, my mother-in-law. He read off all their names and said, "Get in the car, let's go to the burial." We buried our family. I couldn't believe it at the time, I couldn't conceive of it or imagine it . . . And even now I think how shall I explain it to my children when they're older? My children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and grandmother. Kristina didn't love me the way she loved her grandfather and grandmother, they spoiled her. Kristina would always announce, "My grandma is better than anyone!" Now, even though she is getting used to my mother, it's difficult for her, and once she told her: "You're a bad grandmother." I don't know why, I asked her, "Kristina, where's Papa?" and she said, "They killed him." She knows, she understands it all. And recently I scolded Seryozha severely for something, and he started shouting at me, "When Papa comes I'm going to tell him everything!"

University of California Press (Berkeley and Los Angeles), 1967, p. 13. "The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897, however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia." (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of Transcaucasia). In 1920, '0' percent Turk. "We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead." Ohanus Appressian "Men Are Like That" p. 202.

Start of Article (All commets in [*....*] are mine not Dr. Arens) [Comments in square brackets are mine - Yigal] >From "The OTHER Front", July 29, 1992. Translation of Ha'aretz article. Racism in the Knesset --------------------- Coalition requirements on one hand, and the presence of progressive MKs from _Meretz_ in the coalition on the other, have compelled Rabin and his friends to change, to some extent, their attitude towards the Arab public and their representatives in the Knesset. Although he did refuse to view them as partners, taking part in the coalition and joining the government, he did agree to meet with them and to give them a document of intentions which included a commitment to "work towards a decrease in the discrimination between Jewish and Arab citizens". [Decrease WHAT?!?! But posters have told us time and again that such discrimination does not exist *at* *all*! Is Rabin, too, a closet self-hater??? - Yigal]. However, racism has not disappeared. When the Knesset sat to consider who would staff its various committees, a request was made to put an MK from Hadash [the Communist party, one of the "Arab" parties - Yigal] on the State Comptroller's Committee. And oh, did that ever stir up a storm -- including in the ranks of Labor -- since many Knesset members find it unthinkable that an Arab MK sit on one of the important house committees. "Security secrets" are liable to fall into their hands... This attitude -- which until recently had not even aroused criticism, being so natural and so deeply-embossed upon people's hearts -- holds that there are Knesset members who, despite having been elected by tens of thousands of votes, are not entitled to be full partners in the body which represents the people of Israel. We are not speaking here of political discrimination -- which would be bad enough in itself -- but of racial discrimination. The proof: one of the compromises proposed was that MK Mahamid [an Arab - Yigal] should be replaced by Tamar Gojanski [a Jew - Yigal] from the same party. It was not the member's party which was considered unfit, but his race... [* Here is a documented case in a respected Israeli newspaper. *] It is worth noting that for the first time since the state's founding, a public debate has arisen on this subject, as witness the following article: A TEST OF SELF-CONFIDENCE By Gid'on Levi, Ha'aretz, July 26, 1992 Revelations of discrimination against Arabs have become such an integral part of our daily routine that there is not much effort made to deal with them. [Do you hear that, -----? Please contact this Levi fellow and explain to him how little he knows about Israel. Please! - Yigal]. Except that sometimes the demon bursts out from behind the government's window dressing, and then the phenomenon is seven times more serious. Last week provided two more such examples: the Israeli Knesset is finding it very difficult to allow Arab representation on its more important committees; and Israel Television is finding it no less difficult to give a platform to Arabs from the territories. Seemingly two entirely different matters, but in fact they are one and the same. The 13th Knesset proved last week that, even though one third of its members are new faces, it has not renewed its own face at all, at least on one issue. Parliamentary traditions may be modernized and parliamentary traditions may become obsolete, and only one tradition endures forever: no Arab shall set foot in the more important committees of the house. There has never been and never will be an Arab MK on the External Affairs and Defense Committee or on the Finance Committee. Worlds have been overturned over the question of whether or not "to give" Arabs, for the first time, a place on the State Comptroller's Committee. The arguments are old and well-known: In all three of the above committees innumerable secrets are revealed -- and woe unto us if an Arab should hear them. One must not make light of such arguments, but their significance should also not be exaggerated. Every Arab MK is not spending all his time waiting for the opportune moment to hand over information from the Knesset committee room to Black Panther headquarters in Jenin; and not all the aforementioned committees are continually occupied in the discussion of top-secret matters, which could safely be revealed, for example, to MKs supportive of the Jewish Underground, but not to an Arab MK from the Likud, Labor, or even from Hadash. The Arabs themselves would probably forego membership in the Subcommittee on Secret Service Matters, but what would happen, one may ask, if MK Nawaf Masalha were to hear, God forbid, a review of the Foreign Minister in an open meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, or even a review of the Army Chief of Staff which, in any case, are regularly leaked to the next edition of the news. And what would happen if MK Hashem Mahamid were to report on what he had seen with his own eyes at al-Najah? Their non-participation [in important committees] and that of their colleagues, creates an intolerable situation, where Arab members of the elected house have only semi-positions. They are good enough for addressing plenary sessions, and for voting for or against the government and participating in the deliberations of the Immigration and Absorption Committee. But they must not, for example, participate in the process of formulating the state budget in the Finance Committee or in the allocation of resources to local authorities. In any case, they have little part in that. Labor's dependence on the support of the Arab parties has brought about some improvement: MK Hashem Mahamid, will, it seems, participate in the State Comptroller's Committee. Earlier, there had been a ridiculous attempt made to dictate to Hadash who their representative should be, and thus to prevent the Arab from entering this dubious holy-of-holies, but it soon became clear that there was no legal or constitutional backing for such a step. But not to worry: even now the Jewish mind is contriving devices. The new Committee Chair, Roni Milo, has already announced that he will set up subcommittees aplenty for his committee. Thus he will decide where it is permissible for Mahamid to participate and where not. A solution such as this could, by the way, also have been adopted for the rest of the committees, thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets being leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination from the Knesset.

I'm going to count on the supposition that you think through the opinions you have - something which is, by the way, against my better judgment based on what I've seen from you to date. We are agreed, aren't we, that dictionaries are *reference books* for the usage of a given language, and in particular for the meanings of the words and phrases which comprise that language? Now, you are using meanings completely different from, indeed in some cases diametrically different from, those given in the dictionary. As a reference book, a dictionary contains those meanings in both past and (as much as it can) in current use. That's also why they are updated so often. Now, if you are saying things which you give different meanings than the dictionary does, and using non-standard meanings about every word, what is your chance of being taken at face value...? Just about none. Just about no one will take you that way because the words mean something different to them. It's quite clear to me from the response this thread has been getting that that is exactly what is happening. Ponder that. >>>And guess why.

Croats and Muslims may have a right to negotiated secession but they do not have a right to grab the *entire* territories of the former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and B-H. Oh, BTW, *Yugoslavia* was *internationally recognized* when it was destroyed by Tudjman, Izetbegovic, Milosevic, and the international community led by Germany. If Yugoslavia's borders could be changed against its will, then certainly Croatia's borders and B-H's borders can be changed as well. As I have stated many times: the civil war in ex-Yugoslavia will end when the terms of secession (borders, etc.) for Croatia and B-H are finally agreed upon.

If you feel that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact. I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists, the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian criminal organizations. x-Soviet Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up. During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland. The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

But do we write about historical ownership of any place - Palestine, Pakistan, Cyprus, Aegean Islands (and the oil that may lie beneath them), whatever - for any reason other than justification for stomping others? DOES IT TRULY MATTER whose ancestor lived where 20, 200, or 2000 years ago? More than how you treat the land and each other? Who is wise enough to decree that a person's right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness in a particular place depends on accidents of birth? Who can even be sure about the precise tracks of the sperm that birthed the people we wish to despise? IMHO, the American Indians have it right. We belong to the earth, it does not belong to us. Failure to understand that is a good way to cause lossage all the way around. My guess is that once we trash our environment sufficiently we shall die along with it - the baby eating and killing its mother, then dying for lack of milk. Death and disease do not respect national boundaries, not as toxins, disease vectors, lost farmland/wetlands/forest cover/water supplies, nor any other way. When we fight over which national group owns which piece of turf, we are merely contending for the best vantage point from which to kill others, "our" land and eventually ourselves. That is something of which to be proud. Very proud. Makes me glad to be human. I'm not mindlessly rejecting all nationalism. Maybe it's fair to ask whether a recent immigrant deserves a share of the infrastructure that all _my_ ancestors (hah!) labored to produce. But it's an artificial distinction: is the recent immigrant, even a refugee, less likely to contribute to the next generation's legacy than anyone else? [In history the reverse is often the case: recent immigrants strive hardest. If nothing else, they fill open eco(l/n)ogic niches.] Then again, my tribe is infinitely better than your tribe, so I can understand you all have nothing but plot to knock me off. While I, of course, will make sure it doesn't happen, even if I must shoot Muslim infants (or bash Jewish ones against the walls of schoolhouses) to do so. That'll prove my moral superiority, by golly, as well as the rightness of my cause. Clearly, there is no higher purpose in life than killing others because they are not like you. I would never get in the way of such fun. Let's see: soc.culture.turkish - Why don't you Turks go back to Lake Baikal where you came from, and leave the land to the Greeks, who stole it fair and square from the Scythians? soc.culture.pakistan - Why don't you guys redistribute yourselves over India, as God meant for you to do? soc.culture.jewish, soc.culture.arabic - we stick together, fight together, die together. We are brothers, and inseparable. talk.politics.mideast - oh well, had to be there. Oded [Planning on being a Scythian irredentist, as soon as I finish my present assignment.] P.S.: I can't get a semi-decent death threat anymore? P.P.S.: Yeh, the Native Americans had it right. We had to kill them off to keep their sedition from spreading.	1

The 10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of 40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150 mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out of three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev, spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin shepherds from roaming. A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev. But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields in order that the land could be transferred to the army. And now you say noone knows anything about what happened there: No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now confined to seven "development towns", or *sowetos*, established for them. (the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson, email: elias@ismennt.is) So what you basically say is that "we know for sure that nothing good happens there now, we know for sure that the beduins prospered before the Jews arrived and that they were driven away by the Jews, noone on earth knows about what the Jews did there." Is that what you said? Could you proove any of the nonsense you wrote? BTW, try asking beduins in Sinai how they mis the Israelis. Not to mention that there are enough valotaring beduins in the IDF to have at least one full brigade of them. -- --Amos Shapira (Jumper Extraordinaire) | "It is true that power corrupts, C.S.

I wonder whether US or other countries would have risked themselves if only Jews were persecuted and Hitler had no imperialist ambitions. (I am no student of history and I am just asking questions.) If even for a moment you think that I am condoing ethnically motivated violence and killings, you are dead wrong. Let me assure I am not. My only question is this: Do powerful countries have a moral obligation to interefere in other countries if their own interests are not threatened. I cite an essay by Charles Krauthammer in the Time (this week) that discusses this issue eloquently. For example, did US and other European countries abandon their moral compunctions when they chose not to send military troops to Bombay when Hindus, in a rare fit of impassioned rage, killed many Muslims recently. I think not! Under what conditions should US interfere in foregin countries, is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious accusations of religious bigotry and such.

I didn't hear any thing that said that the current Govt. of Haiti asked for it, nor is there any real precedent (barring Somalia) for the UN getting involved in internal conflicts. That might also answer question 2). The neo-colonial countries are a diffuse lot - the UN (Security Council). And while I am at it, I'll take a stab at 1) - the new colonialism, as defined in most articles I have read, would entail something of the nature of Trusteeship under the UN Sec. Council, democracy, aid, education, free-markets, free press and then out for the colonialists, now assured that there is a "civilized" country that they have left behind. Note I don't support this idealized concept, simply because I think it is a lot of hogwash. -- Srinivas Sunder sunder@crhc.uiuc.edu If The University of Illinois shares these views, I'd be surprised.

(Re: the newsgroup -- followups set to talk.politics.mideast where this belongs.) This may make the term 'civil war' dubious, but it does nothing to the phrase 'destroy the government'. An occupying government is still a govern- ment, and the Palestinians have made it quite clear that their goal is not simply to prevent it from occupying the territories that don't con- fer citizenship (which is your own determination of the distinction) but to wipe it out entirely (and, not incidentally, the entire Jewish population it rules with it). This is an intent to 'destroy the government', no matter where the government happens to be from. >If the >current government in Isreal would be willing to let all adult individuals >who are capable to >vote in elections within the _DEFACTO_ boundaries of the Isreali >state, a requirement for being called a democracy in my opinion, Wasn't a requirement for democracy in Athens. For that matter, isn't a requirement for the term democracy in the United States, which doesn't let non-citizens vote either. Both the United States and Israel have processes whereby it is possible to acquire citizenship, with a great deal of effort and a modicum of screening -- it's just that it isn't automatic for living in the territories. It isn't automatic for living in New York, either. That said, suit yourself. Having never considered democracy the ultimate in Good In This World, I could care less if you feel like calling Israel, or America, or anywhere else, a democracy.

Again, suit yourself. In which case Israel is *not* attacking its own people, it is fighting a war on foreign soil, in which case the residents are entitled to play rough, yes -- but Israel's allowed to get just as rough, within the bare limits of the rules of war. This includes, among other things, the right to shoot or bomb *anyone* a national of the coun- try in question who is fighting them (which permits mass frontal assault on all rock-throwers), along with the right to take out any installation of military importance (certain villages with too-good fortifications can be handled by aerial bombing, as can waterways since they count as supply lines to the enemy), and the right to do anything whatsoever to whatever constitutes a government that they can lay hands on (if Hamas is trying to set up as the ruling party, let them beware). If this is not the scenario you want, I recommend you go back to calling it a civil war. Civil wars have to be handled nicer. You cannot say the Palestinians are a nation fighting a resistance war against a foreign nation and still call Israel a government who is treating its own people cruelly.

In fact, correct me if I am wrong, Serbs are attacking Bosnians with their battle cries "Death to the Turks!". Is this so shocking? Years of communism apparently suppressed their hatred and anger towards the Turks. But such hatred is obviously one that dies hard. Serbs must understand, Turks are no longer the good old barbarians world has come to know by propaganda after propaganda. Serbs must further understand that barbarism does not work. Serbs must even further understand that barbarism would one day have to face counter-barbarism. So, I urge those people [Serbs] to stop killing Bosnian women and children.

First of all, even if you identify yourself as completely Jewish that doesn't rule out the possibility that you're a self-hating anti-semite.

Under Serbian-led regime between the two world wars, many Croats were also killed (especially during the dictatorship introduced on Jan. 6, 1929). Some Croats formed a resistance movement "Ustashas" (Insurgents) and were forced into exile, to fascist Italy, which sheltered them. In exile, they practiced a terrorist approach to liberating Croatia; while Croats in Croatia followed the approach of peaceful negotiations under the leadership of Vladko Macek. After the Axis powers took control in the SECOND world war, Vladko Macek refused to collaborate, so Ustashas were brought in to run the newly formed puppet state. This state included both Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and its ideology saw Muslims as the best Croats ("flowers of Croatian people"). Some Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina therefore joined Ustashas. However, even more others did not; they joined Tito's Partisans. The Ustashas membership peaked at less than 1% of Croat and Muslim population of that area at that time. After WWII, Muslims were still considered a religious minority descended from Croats or Serbs who converted to Islam centuries ago. But, in 1968, it was decided that forcing Muslims to declare their nationality as either Serbs or Croats is not a good policy. Dobrica Cosic, the current president of the rump Yugoslavia, was strongly opposed, and sought to prevent the category "Muslim" (in an ethnic sense) from appearing on the next census. He was criticized and expelled from the party. So, since that time, Bosnian Muslims are considered a separate nationality, although some still deny this and insist that they choose either Serb or Croat nationality. Sincerely, Josip	1

According to my dictionary, Zi-on-ism: an international movement orig. for the establishment of a Jewish national or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of modern Israel. Now, I do not support the establishment of nations based on religious principles, while I support the establishment of nations based on cultural identities. So. Here are some questions I have to ask for anyone to answer. My point is what someone said long time ago: In politics, like with men, it is important to distiguish between what they say they do and what they are actually doing. 1) My mother is Jewish (and so is my father). If I apply for the Law of Return, do I get in as a Jew trying to return to his land, from which my family was expelled about 2000 years ago? 2) If I go back, which nationality would my ID show? 3) If I decided to go back to the land from which my relatives had been expelled 2000 years ago, but first I convert to any other religion, can I apply to the law of Return as a member of the Jewish Nation or should I apply as someone whose mother is Jewish? 4) Which nationality would show my ID in case 3)? 5) What has change in me between the day before and the day after I converted to loose my being part of the Jewish Nation? 6) Suppose I want to get married to my current wife, who is non-Jewish in Israel, how do I do it? 7) How would my situation change if I decided, after going back to Israel, to convert to Islam? Now, here is one more question. I do believe that most people in a country do not care about politics. They just want to be left alone. Suppose my father is Arab. Suppose he was born in Palestine, in some place which now is part of Israel. Suppose that his father, and his grandfather as well as 20 or 30 generations before him were born in that place. Now suppose there is a war of independence and my father, scared by all the fighting going on, tries to take his family to a place more secure, among people he knows, who speak a language he understands, who worship the same god. Now, suppose that that place is some other Arab country. And, now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created where my father used to live, and that that country is called Israel. And, that in that country, Jews from all over the world are received. And that people whose family left thet country 200 generation ago are recieved and granted full-citizenship. Should I, if I decided to go back to my father's land, where he was born as 20 or 30 generations of my family were born, have the right to go back and ask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 2000 years? Then, finally, people ask me how I would define a Jew, but that is irrelevant. I am not talking about how I would define a Jew, but about how people in Zionist organizations, and more important, in Israel, define a Jew. How would those who are Zionist define a Jew? > >> Eric S.

And rightly so. The author of this crap is a racist, pure and simple. He obviously has no qualms about being open with it, either, unlike some other Arab- and Mulsim-bashers on the Net. Now, I for one, am not going to look at Joachim's posting and infer from it that all Jews think this way. Sure, there might be some, but this view is not a part of Judaism, and it is stupid to believe that all Jews' minds are this twisted. However, some Muslims might look at Joachim's flame as a reaffirmation of their worst fears about Jews: that they all hate Arabs and are racists. For this reason, I am alarmed that not more Jews on the Net have spoken out against what Joachim has said. They have the chance to possibly change the anti-semitic views of some people on the net, to show them that all Jews do *not* hate all Arabs and Muslims, just like all Muslims do *not* hate all Jews.

At the very least [BH] we can say that both sides exchanged shelling, with occasional [BH] aerial raids by Israel on Lebanese villages. [BH] In any case Steve's characterization that the 1982 invasion was only in [BH] response to years of shelling from Lebanon is false.

Basil, I was only correcting Steve's statement that Geurillas were shelling Israel from the Golan, which was absurd. The fact that "Israel did much more shelling" was in response to Palestinian shelling from Lebanon. Israel has no intention of keeping an inch of Lebanese territory. Israel will continue to fight Hizbullah, PLO, FPLP etc. as long as its northern border is not quiet. If the Lebanese army can control these elements then I think we can see genuine peace on the Israel-Lebanese border. I remind you that a couple thousand Lebanese cross each day into Israel to work. As for the election of Bashir Gemayel, it is true that he was favorable to Israel, is that why the Syrians killed him?

II., p. 188. "The atrocities and massacres which have been committed for a long time against the Muslim population within the Armenian Republic have been confirmed with very accurate information, and the observations made by Rawlinson, the British representative in Erzurum, have confirmed that these atrocities are being committed by the Armenians. The United States delegation of General Harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came to take refuge with Kazim Karabekir's soldiers, hungry and miserable, their children and wives, their properties destroyed, and the delegation was a witness to the cruelties. Many Muslim villages have been destroyed by the soldiers of Armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns before the eyes of Karabekir's troops and the people. When it was hoped that this operation would end, unfortunately since the beginning of February the cruelties inflicted on the Muslim population of the region of Shuraghel, Akpazar, Zarshad, and Childir have increased. According to documented information, 28 Muslim villages have been destroyed in the aforementioned region, more than 2,000 people have been slaughtered, many possessions and livestock have been seized, young Muslim women have been taken to Kars and Gumru, thousands of women and children who were able to flee their villages were beaten, raped and massacred in the mountains, and this aggression against the properties, lives, chastity and honour of the Muslims continued. It was the responsibility of the Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities committed by the Armenians, that the possessions taken from the Muslims be returned and that indemnities be paid, that the properties, lives, and honour of the Muslims be protected."

First of all, this is NOT a strife; this is a massacre of innocent Moslem poeples by the Christian West. Since Ottoman lost the control of Balkans, many tens and hundereds of millions of Muslem peoples (Turks, Albanians, Bosnians, and others) have been tortured, raped, massacred, and driven out of their homes by the Cristians of both the region and Europe. Some lucky ones escaped to relative safety in Turkiye. The remaining others are being finished now by local Christians, the USA, and the rest of Europe. The Christian West is maintaining a tight arms ambargo on the Muslem peoples of Bosnia so they cannot deffend themslves while letting Christian Serbs and Croats torture, rape, and massacre the innocent Moslem peoples of Bosnia. It took Christian Europe for almost six centuries to achieve this objective of theirs and I do not think they will let it up. This will go on untill every single Moslem person (Bosnian, Turk, Albanian, etc) is tortured, raped, massacred, and driven out of their homes.	1

Although I don't want to muddy the waters unnecessarily I disagree. Any discrimination based on religion is not and cannot be racist unless the sole qualification for religious membership is racial. This is not the case for Israel although it might get a little closer than, say, Islam. This of course raises the vexed question of Church AntiSemitism. Jews have been heavily discriminated against on the grounds of religion in many Christian countries. If we take Russia as an example Jews were seriously persecuted but that persecution in the eyes of the Church and State stopped at the baptismal font. Officially anyway. If a Jew converted there were no legal barriers in his way (that I know of anyway.) Peter the Great's Interior Minister came from such a convert background. Can we then claim that the Russian Orthodox did not teach AntiSemitism and was not AntiSemitic? Similarly for the Roman Catholic Church? I suspect so as this is not a racial 'taint' but one based on belief and AS is after all a form of racism. Well maybe not. What is AntiSemitism then if not something racially based?

Congradulations tim. I think the other people answered you on most of the factual parts(esp. about the internal conflicts policy). Israel very often gets away with more than most other nations (Due to U.S. vetos). While I am not familiar with every instance I know that the reason Saudi Arabia was not condemned for killig the pilgrims was that the pilgrims were iranian. Yes, the UN is biased but mostly in favor of the US and its allies (Including Israel, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan) and against "Outlaw" countries like iran and more recently Iraq. Far be it from me to support the repressive governments there but I think they get more slack than Israel for things they do "wrong". Again the reason some condemnations don't occur lies in the race or country of the victims. The gassed Iraqi kurds got associated with Iran in the war and since Iran was perceived as worse than Iraq no condemnation resulted. The palestinians killed by arab countries involved another case of who cares. It seems that until very recently no one cared about how many palestinians died anywhere (including in Israel and the occupied territories). Again I appreciate the lack of personal insults.	1

Organization: Tufts University - Medford, MA Lines: 27 The honest answer to your question about Arabs who were expelled from Jaffa, and/or who fled Jaffa, or anywhere else in Israel, having the right to return is: Yes, unfortunately, they have the right to return. They may apply for citizenship like any other non-Israeli and then go to >Jaffa and try to buy their house back from the Jews who now own it. And now a question and answer for you: Can the Jews who were born and raised in Hebron, or their descendants go back to THEIR homes in Hebron? The answer is: absolutely NOT, because they were almost all murdered by their Arab neighbors - the "palestinians". Now, do I think the Arabs should be allowed to even visit "their" homes in Jaffa? Hell, no. Bring back the Jews of Hebron, Petah Tikva, Jerusalem, Safed, etc. Then, perhaps I would be in favor of Arabs returning to their Jaffa homes.

Early Zionist fighters did no such things. This is historically incorrect. Early Zionist 'fighters' did indeed target civilians.

The question of responsibility for the massacres or deportation of nearly all Ottoman Armenians has evolved into a polemic. Hundreds of books, articles, and documents have been published to describe the horrifying scenes of violence and death. Many writers, such as the British Bryce and Toynbee, French Pinon, German Lepsius, American Morganthau and Gibbons, have insisted that the massacres were predetermined and ruthlessly executed. The have refuted the Ottoman government's official publications and justifications by substantiating that anti-Armenian measures were deliberated by the Ittihadists even before the outbreak of war. The fact remains than an estimated eight hundred thousand to over a million Armenians perished within a few months, and several hundred thousand more succumbed in the following years to the ravages of disease, famine, and refugee life.

I knew him to be Turkey's man; due to my reading knowledge of Turkish and my seniority over him, I was a member of the promotion committee. For that case, I sat down and read his entire treatise "History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey". It took me three months and I found out, from volume I, that he had plagiarized Uzun Jarsoglu, an eminent Turkish specialist on Ottoman history. Shaw himself claimed in his introduction that his treatise was the outcome of a 20-year search through the Ottoman Archives. Well, I went on leave and managed to show 40% of Volume I, containing around 5000 sentences, to be the result of plagiarism, matching each sentence with passages from the original work. He had even reproduced the errors. So I produced a 500-pages manuscript and submitted a 60-pages report on Shaw's plagiarism. The University, however, rejected my report and, after a closed meeting, promoted Stanford Shaw to Distinguished Professor. I paid a price for all this: upset by the whole process, I confronted the entire University structure and was considered to be a chauvinist and madman. I asked for permission to run a seminar on Shaw's book that was denied by the President of the University. While the Center for Near Eastern Studies granted me permission, the President was depriving me of my academic freedom. Luckily, the Dean refused to give in and I did run the seminar, attended by more than 150 academic people, in which I uncovered Stanford Shaw, who refused to attend.

In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1] "Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews) when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing." Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews - extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian. "We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities against our people (Jews). Members of our family witnessed the murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors. Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise to grant themselves government if, in return, the Armenians would help exterminate Jews. Armenians were also hearty proponents of the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists." Signed Elihu Ben Levi, Vacaville, California. [1] James G. Mandalian, 'Dro, Drastamat Kanayan,' in the 'Armenian Review,' a Quarterly by the Hairenik Association, Inc., Summer: June 1957, Vol. X, No. 2-38. And stick around...

No, they killed soldiers so that the British government would leave. The objective was not to scare civilains, but show that the cost of staying was way too high. In contrast, a terrorist kills civilains to scare other civilains. They use random violence against people to make a point that no one is safe until their demands are met.

Thats because you missed the essential point of arab terrorism, which is to scare civilains away from Israel, by killing those who have something to do with Israel. It is to kill Jews because they might be Zionists. It is to kill people who live in Israel because of where they live. The targets are rarely soldiers, or other people who understand they might be attacked in the line of duty, but innocent civilians, to underscore the message that no one who deals with Israel is safe. > I'll reiterate again.... both sides are screwy, but >I'll favor the underdog in this case because I do think they >were a bit screwed.

To argue that a Palestinian police force would be established in order to control peaceful political groups only reinforces the reality that the Palestinian leadership, so far, can not exercise control over radical Palestinian elements nor effectively deal with the killing of Palestinians by Palestinians.

Yes they did want to kill the inhabitants and many of them were killed. This is of course simple to resolve, the Haganah sent a soldier to report on the massacre. He brought a photographer with him. He sent in a report. The Israeli government suppressed it. Now the government was a Labour Government. Since then the Revisionists have gotten into power but for some reason Likud didn't release the report and its pictures either. Perhaps you might want to tell me why? If it happened as you claim then there will be no pictures of men shot in the head with their hands tied behind their backs, no women and children shot as they slept. Yet for some reason they did not take the chance to clear their own name. You have a reason for this don't you? I somehow doubt it.

Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack on the part of the Jews, and a massacre defines it best in my opinion. The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with the Jews, a peace pact, but the Irgun purposely broke this agreement in order to scare off the Palestinians. I might grant that this village housed armed Arabs [I doubt it] but nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that this was a motivating force amongst the Irgun. The Deir Yassin MASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the Palestinians to flee the Jewish Homeland.,...and contrary to your belief, many civilians were killed. Deir Yassin was later advertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was useful in getting many Palestinians to leave. The Palestinians were rightfully scared off, because they did not want another Deir Yassin. I'm not necessarily condemning the Israelites here; atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the Arabs. Israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are and were the good guys in the middle east. Both Arab and Jew suck equally.	1

I agree with you. But I also feel that when a culture feels it is confronted by another group that wishes to see that culture "disassembled", the first culture has little choice but to *try* to secure its "survival" as well as maintain its moral center. Since the culture is not about to turn away from *either* the matter of its survival or the valuing of its moral principles, it has the virtually impossible job of "balancing". To discuss Israel's faults and "crimes" without *any* recognition of this circumstance and *reality* it faces is a conscious decision based on the discussant's political biases, NOT on an honest and empathetically open understanding of the situation. The same applies to those who attempt to paint the Palestinian movement as "all bad" and dispense with considerations of the *reality* facing them. > >>That certainly describes Elias, >>since he has no intention of recognizing that, alongside the Palestinian >>experience and perspective, there exists also that of Israelis. > >He might not want to recognize that.

You beg the question by centering on the symptoms while the issue of "self-hating" addresses the motivations. I certainly feel that anyone who expends so much effort inflating, distorting and robbing human context from aspects of his/her own culture is reflecting a degree of dislike for it. Since bits of that culture are bound, due to his/her upbringing, to be a part of him/her, a bit of self- dislike seems likely to be mixed in somewhere. >>>> >>>> "Who is a Jew?

I did *not* find the approach of those opposing Davidsson to be centered *at all* on a denigration and denial of the "other side". I certainly do wonder if the degree to which Davidsson's views on the Middle East have distorted is connected to his dislike and rejection of his jewish lineage.

The obsession with discussions of past (or present) events seems to be largely centered on trying to "prove" that "they" are worse than "us".

It's as if we've become addicted to periodic injections of "self-affirmation" that draw their power from denigration of the "other" and romanticization of ourselves. The hope is that we will begin sometime to apply these discussions in some way towards consideration of how to defuse the situation, advancement of negotiations and the search for common ground between the parties involved. Of course, for this to happen we can't believe that the best path to *making ourselves feel better* is at the expense of others. As long as those valuing the coming together of "opposing" parties do not pursue their vision with the same passion as do those polarization specialists, we will stay stuck in the circus of one-upsmanship we now have.

Source: "World Alive, A Personal Story" by Robert Dunn. Crown Publishers, Inc., New York (1952). (Memoirs of an American officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people) p. 361 (seventh paragraph) and p. 362 (first paragraph). 'The most are inside houses. Come you and look.' 'No, dammit! My stomach isn't-' 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform. Him you must see.' "We were under those trees by the mosque, in an open space.... 'I don't believe you," I said, but followed to a nail-studded door. The man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse. I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and went inside. The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted, as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his slashed genitals." p. 363 (first paragraph). 'How many people lived there?' 'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned. 'Did you see any Turk officers?' 'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.' "The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me - Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion, Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would have been. From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around..... The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags, looms, even spinning-wheels. 'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains. Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'" p. 354. "At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian, but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on Moslem villages." p. 358. "It will be three hours to take," Dro told me. We'd close in on three sides. "The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets," Merrimanov said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow. "That is for morale," Dro put in. "We must keep the Moslems in terror." "Soldiers or civilians?" I asked. "There is no difference," said Dro. "All are armed, in uniform or not." "But the women and children?" "Will fly with the others as best they may." p. 360. "The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.' Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling; then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though I heard our Utica brass roar. As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed, dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly. The came a shrill wailing. Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot. 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries. At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly, through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb." p. 361 (fourth paragraph). "Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun dress. The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed just below his neck, into the spine. There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead." p. 358. "...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled north. My hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands, Turkish troop shifts, hidden arms, spies - Christian, Red or Tartar - coming in from Transcaucasus. Then they spoke of the hell that would break loose if Versailles were to put, as threatened, the six 'Armenian' vilayets of Turkey under the control of Erevan... An Armenia without Armenians! Turks under Christian rule? His lips smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache. That's bloodshed - just Smyrna over again on a bigger scale."

These criteria are to be found for example in the 1. International Convention for Abolition of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ratified by most countries) 2. The International Covenant of Political and Civil Rights 3. The Human Rights Charter 4. The European Convention of Human Rights If one reads carefully how racial discrimination is defined in these legally binding instruments, and does not resort to sophistry, it is obvious that the State of Israel is guilty of racial discrimination. The people suffering the most extreme form of racial discriminatnion by the Zionist regime are the Palestinian refugees, some of whom live under Israeli military control and others who live in the diaspora. They are not entitled to return to their homeland for the sole reason that they are not Jews. International law does not include any provisions which permits such denial of rights, under any circumstance. Israel's actions of denial are totally illegal and immoral. By allowing the return of the refugees and permitting them to settle in Tel in any area of the State of Israel, the State would finally gain its legitimaty under international law and could be justified in asking to be recognized. It would facilitate the peaceful integration of Israel into the Middle-east and constitute the best guarantee for permanent Jewish presence - in the area. Any attempt to create a separation, formal and human, between the Israeli Jewish and Palestinian Arab communities, is fraught with genociadal implications. I hope that U.S. Jews, who sincerely wish that peace prevail in Israel/Palestine, will finally realize this fact.

Compare the tacit appoval that the world gives to Muslims who randomly murder Jewish civilians to the righteous indignation expressed if people in the occupied territories are kept from working in Israel in an effort to reduce these random murders from occuring, while everyone knows that no country is at all required to accept foreign workers, except Israel, of course. Jewish blood has always been cheap. The non-Jewish world ha never regarded any form of Jewish suffering important, except when the Jews were the models of the powerless victim holding the high moral ground, as it had been just after World War 2. However, as soon as the Jewish people started to take care of themselves, the ancient hatred of Jews was unleashed again. I doubt if the non-Jewish world is even capable of having any compassion towards Jews as anti-semitism is so ancient and so basic to both Christianity and Islam. Golda Meir said that there would be peace when the Arabs love their own children more than they hate the Jews. And while I know that there are more Arab parents who love their children than those who would send their children out into the streets to throw rocks at men trained to defend themselves with guns, the world is so obsessed by a hatred of Jews trying to defend themselves that they have yet to even question the actions of those parents who not simply allow their children to do this, but encourage them to throw themselves into harm's way. Even Arab children are expendable, if their tragic deaths are used in the neverending propoganda battle to blame Israel, and the Jews, for any misfortune befalling Arabs in the middle east. * * * * * * * Who is a Jew?

Let's take a little stroll through a few of Elias Davidsson's contributions to our understanding of the middle east. ED> Quotations from Zionist leaders ED> 1. "There was no such thing as Palestinians" ED> (Golda Meir, Prime Minister of Israel, London Sunday ED> Times, 15 June 1969) And what do suggest that she meant by this? Do you think she meant that the Palestinians don't exist? Or does it actually mean that the people who self-identify as 'Palestinians,' did not appear to be a distinct ethnic group in the eyes of Golda Meir? ED> 2. "There is, however, a difficulty from which the Zionist ED> dares not avert his eyes, though he rarely likes to face it. ED> Palestine proper has already its inhabitants." ED> (Israel Zangwill, The Voice of Jerusalem, London 1920, ED> p.88) When this was written, seventy three years ago, the people of the region were not all Jews. They are not all Jews now. No Jew but the most rabid bigot has ever called for an Israel to be ONLY for Jews. That was true then. It is true now. ED> "[The Palestinians are] beasts walking on two legs." ED> (Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel in a speech to ED> the Knesset, ED> quoted in Amnon Kapeliouk, 'Begin and the "Beasts", New ED> Statesman, 25 June 1982) Since you inserted the words 'The Palestinians are' we cannot know what Begin was talking about. For someone who wants to embellish his own importance with an absurd pseudo-organizational name like the 'Center for Policy Research,' you are not a very honest person. ED> "Both the process of expropriation [of the Palestinians] ED> and the removal of the poor must be carried out ED> discreetly and circumspectly". ED> (Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press, ED> 1960, I., p.88) Herzl died eighty nine years ago. Are you suggesting that he has stated what is Israel's policy today? Have you ever seen Israel even entertain a policy to exclude non-Jews, let alone actually try to remove non-Jews from Israel? If you actually believe that this quote has anything to do with Israel's non- Jewish citizenry today, you are an idiot. But if you realize that Israel has no intention of removing non-Jewish Israelis, then you are nothing but a common liar. This one time I will give you the benefit of the doubt, and assume you are stupid. ED> "We shall try to spirit the penniless population [the ED> Palestinians] across the border by procuring employment ED> for it in the transit countries, while denying it any ED> employment in our own country" ED> (Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press, 1960, ED> I, p.88) Once again you quote a man gone for almost a century. You do so within the context of modern day Israel. Thomas Jefferson owned slaves. How does this fact define the United States today? ED> "[Jews] must expel Arabs and take their place" ED> (David Ben Gurion, 1937, quoted in Shabtai Teveth, Ben ED> Gurion and the Palestine Arabs, Oxford University Press, ED> 1985, p. 89) Did he say 'Jews,' or did you add this? This was also a statement from ten years before Israel became a state. It has no bearing on Israel. ED> "We must do everything to ensure they [the ED> Palestinian refugees] never do return" ED> (David Ben Gurion, in his diary, 19 July 1948, quoted in ED> Michael Bar Zohar, Ben Gurion: The Armed Prophet, ED> Prentice-Hall, 1967, p.157) YOU added the words 'the Palestinian refugees.' And by doing so, you are misleading people into believing that Ben Gurion, who was expressing his hope that people who fled their lands, at the encouragement of people such as KING ABDULLAH, and the MUFTI OF JERUSALEM, was gloating over people abandoning their homes. What he was refering to were the Arabs with whom Jews were at war. ED> "The country was mostly an empty desert, with only ED> a few islands of Arab settlement" ED> (Shimon Peres, Minister of Defense, quoted in David's ED> Sling: The Arming of Israel, Weidenfeld and Nicholson, ED> 1970, p.249) At the time of the rebirth of Israel this was certainly true, especially when compared to what Israel has accomplished in a few short decades. ED> "All this story about the danger of extermination [of ED> Jews] has been blown up....to justify the annexation of ED> new Arab territories" ED> (Mordechai Bentov, Israeli Cabinet Minister, Al ED> Hamishmar, 14 April 1972) Since Israel has not annexed even one millimeter of territory in more twenty six years, this quote is irrelevant. ED> "Neither Jewish ethics nor Jewish tradition can ED> disqualify terrorism as a means of combat" ED> (Yitzhak Shamir, Hehazit, Summer 1943 [Journal of the ED> LEHI, the Stern Gang], translated from the Israeli daily ED> Al-Hamishmar, 24 December 1987 Again, you are quoting a man who was fighting for what he had been promised from a time as ancient as biblical, to the time of the Balfour Declaration, just a few short years back. And what was thought of and described as terrorism by Jews didn't include slaughtering Olympic athletes, brutally murdering the innocent, attacking school buses, and murdering another human being for the sole reason that he or she is an Arab. ED> "The domination of Jewish agriculture by Arab ED> workers is a cancer in our body" ED> (A. Uzan, Israeli Minister of Agriculture, Ha'aretz, 13 ED> December 1974) There were serious concerns about a work force that consisted of people from OUTSIDE Israel. It is a wise to be concerned. A work force consisting of foreigners is not a good situation for a country. ED> "There can be only one national home in Palestine, ED> and that a Jewish one, and no equality in the partnership ED> between Jews and Arabs" ED> (Montague David Eder, President of the Zionist ED> Federation of Great Britain, 1931, ED> in Doreen Ingrams, comp., Palestine Papers 1917-1922, ED> Seeds of Conflict, George Braziller, 1973, p. 135) This also has no meaning for a country formed seventeen years after this statement was made. Obviously times change. This is NOT what Israel is about today. I believe the peace talks make this quote irrelevant. ED> "There is not a single Jewish village in this country ED> that has not been built on the site of an Arab village" ED> (Moshe Dayan, Ha'aretz, 4 April 1969...) This is completely false. ED> "Some people talk of expelling 700,000 to 800,000 ED> Arabs in the event of a new war, and instruments have ED> been prepared" ED> (Aharon Yariv, former chief of Israeli military ED> intelligence, 1980, Inquiry, 8 December 1980) Expelled from where? Israel? The occupied territories? New Jersey? Is there any way we can read this and get an idea as to what on earth he was talking about. Obviously not. ED> "We should there [in Palestine] form a portion of the ED> rampart of Europe against Asia, an outpost of civilization ED> as opposed to barbarism." ED> (Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Jewish State, London, 1896, p. ED> 29) Interesting notion. Considering that this was written nearly a century ago, it is quite visionary. ED> "I deeply believe in launching preventive war ED> against the Arab States without further hesitation. By ED> doing so we will achieve two targets: firstly, the ED> annihilation of Arab power; and secondly, the expansion ED> of our territory" ED> (Menachem Begin, in a speech to the Knesset, 12 October ED> 1955) This was said nearly forty years ago. Begin is dead. And it should be obvious to anybody that if Israel was expansionist, it would have ANNEXED the occupied territories right after it captured them. Israel would not be negotiating to get rid of them. ED> "During the last 100 years our people have been in a ED> process of building up the country and the nation, of ED> expansion, of getting additional Jews and additional ED> settlements in order to expand the borders here. Let no ED> Jew say that the process has ended. Let no Jew say that ED> we are near the end of the road." ED> (Moshe Dayan, Ma'ariv, 7 July 1968) He's dead, too. And since Israel has not annexed ANY land at all since 1967, you are once again wasting bandwidth with all of these misleading quotes. They are so out of sync with the reality of Israel, that you do nothing but make yourself look like a fanatic desperate to sway people, by misleading them. ED> "Let us not today fling accusations at the [Palestinian ED> Arab] murderers. Who are we that we should argue ED> against their hatred ? For eight years now they sit in ED> their refugee camps in Gaza, and before their very eyes, ED> we turn into our homestead the land and the villages in ED> which they and their forefathers have lived.

It's true that we should never lose sight of the plight of these people. We should also recognize that this quote preceded the disgusting wave of Arab terrorism and violence directed at innocent people, that began in 1972 with the massacre of the Israeli athletes in Munich, and continues to this day. If your ability to obscure was the equal of your desire to do so, truthseekers in this group would have a problem. But you are an easily recognized fanatic, whose stream of misleading, partial, and out-of-context quotes are totally unfettered by the burden of truth.	1

Center for Regional Studies Lines: 53 May 13, 1993 _Five Russian soldiers sentenced to death in Azerbaijan_ MOSCOW (UPI) -- Five soldiers who served in Russia's 7th army stationed in Armenia were sentenced to death in the Azerbaijani capital Baku Thursday for allegedly "carrying out diversions and killing 30 Azeri soldiers." A statement released by the news service of Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey said "the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal," the Russian state news agency Itar-tass reported. But the Russian Foreign Ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed over to the authorities in Moscow for punishment. "This would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have committed crimes," the statement reads. The five men, together with another soldier who received a 15-year prison sentence, were captured in September 1992 by Azeri police in the Kelbadzhar district of Azerbaijan, between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. The Supreme Court in Baku said the men had gone through special training in a company of the Russian 7th army in the Armenian capital Yerevan, after which they were sent across the Armenian-Azeri border into Nagorno-Karabakh to carry out diversions against Azeri troops. However, the Russian Foreign Ministry statement claimed they had deserted the Russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with Armenian armed forces in the battle zone round Karabakh. Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan which for five years has been fighting for independence from Baku in a war that has left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes. Both Yerevan and Baku have always claimed that Russian servicemen stationed in these Caucasian republics, who were left behind after the break-up of the Soviet Union, are fighting as mercenaries in the Karabakh war. The statement from Moscow said the Russian side repeatedly appealed to the Azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the six men, and to hand them over to the Russian authorities. It said that President Boris Yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request to his Azeri counterpart Elchibey. Itar-tass said that the soldiers' defense attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency. -- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "Armenia has not learned a lesson in S.D.P.A.

As a result Serbs did take a beating from Croats (NOT Bosnian Moslems) while Germany had the upper hand. Even today, Russians consider/call Serbs as their Slovac brothers. This is one of the issues involved in the U.N.'s lack of active intervention against Serbs. As for the Bosnian Moslems, I have not heard of any alliance with Germany or Russia in recent history.

But I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda, in fact, for the past century or two, Croats and Muslims have seen themselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendly relations. Your suggestion that Croat-Muslim relationship is anything like Serb-Muslim relationship is completely wrong. To say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not imply they are not separate peoples. The events of the past two years clearly show Muslim determination to remain separate: in their alliance with Croats, they maintained this separation. Croats would have accepted a much closer relationship, I think. This century plus of building bridges between these two friendly peoples is now at risk, because of the inexorable logic of war. Since Bosnian Serbs (32% of population) have 10 times more heavy weapons than Bosnian Muslims (44%) and Croats (17%) combined, they have squeezed Muslims and Croats into only 30% of the territory. Muslims lost more territory than Croats (who built defenses early on). Under these conditions, any alliance is bound to fall apart since it is easier to recover lost land from Croats than from Serbs. The only thing keeping this in check was the hope of reversal of fortunes through foreign military intervention and lifting of the arms embargo. Since Warren Christopher had no luck persuading the Europeans to go along with this, this hope was dashed. Having no prospect of outside help, the former allies turned on each other, like two starved animals in a tight cage. This inexorable logic, of course, got plenty of help from Serbian intelligence operatives, who were doing everything to build mistrust between Croats and Muslims for over a year. A timely intervention to stop Serbian aggression would have prevented this. Sadly, nothing was done to create a balance of power on the ground. As long as the Serbs enjoy 10:1 advantage, they can break any alliance, even among friends. This is tragic, but hardly new: "divide et impera" was used by ancient Romans with success. In my view, Bosnian Muslims and Croats managed to resist this divisive strategy reasonably well until May 9, 1993, when the hope of reversal of fortunes was lost. I have a question for the distinguished diplomats: do they believe Balkan peoples are experimental cannon fodder? I'd like to know what did they expect when they decided to enforce the arms embargo which solidified Serbian 10:1 advantage in heavy weapons; how did they expect to prevent fragmentation of the Muslim and Croat defense forces; and how on Earth do they hope to restore peace without justice? The implications of this immoral approach I cannot begin to predict, but I am filled with foreboding... Sincerely, Josip	1

"The setting up of a police force is not part of the 'gesture package', but deals with the very heart and substance of the Palestinian struggle for national identity. As it turns out, the main objective guiding the prime minister in the setting up of a Palestinian police force - and apparently also supported by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres - is to ensure the holding of democratic elections in the territories." Thus writes Amnon Barzilai in his editorial (Israeli daily Hadashot, 23 April), and his position articulates the thinking of most of the commentators who dealt with this issue in the past two weeks. Over against them stand the settlers and rightwing parties, who also interpret the decision to encourage the establishment of a Palestinian police force as a significant step towards the instituting of real autonomy, something which will restrict what can be done by the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. With a variety of demonstrations, including street theater on 'What will happen when there is a Palestinian police force', rightwing elements are attempting to frighten the Israeli public and to pressure Rabin to go back on his decision. Members of the Kach movement have even begun to organize a 'settler police force' in the Occupied Territories, as counter-balance to the future Palestinian police force. However, as Barzilai points out, the main function of the new police force - as far as the Israeli government is concerned - has nothing to do with the settlers, over whom they will apparently have no authority, but will control political groups within the Palestinian population, whom the government is interested in neutralizing. Writes Barzilai: "...According to ideas currently taking shape, the setting up of a local police force in the territories will precede, not only the stage of electsion, but also the final stages of the preparing of the interim autonomy agreement. "The willingness of the Israeli government to set up a local Palestinian police force is evidence that the government is serious about arriving at a settlement with the Palestinians..." It's no wonder that the Palestinian public is also greatly worried about this new Israeli initiative. And it is inevitable that pressure will be brought to bear on Faisal Husseini and the rest of the delegation members, from a variety of directions, to refuse the gift which Rabin would like to give them. But at this stage, it looks like the Palestinians are cooperating in the fulfillment of his plans. ---------------------------------------------------- Add'l comment by E.D.: Numerous Palestinians fear that Israel might succeed in co-opting some Palestinian circles by this idea. They fear that a Palestinian police force, controlled in fact by Israel, might act even more brutally than the IDF. The idea of using a surrogate police force is not new. It is used by Israel in Lebanon and was used by the Nazis to control Jewish ghetto-dwellers.	1

A very small part of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to. Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in Erzurum.

However, This is quite a misrepresentation. After WWI, many Bosnian Muslims were killed and their land taken over by Serbs, and the motive was plunder, not some fictitious "supression of rebellion." Even earlier, one can point to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of Muslims. Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic, political adviser to the Serbian monarchic regime, says in his memorandum "The Expulsion of the Arnauts" which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic on March 7, 1937, in Belgrade: The Mode of Removal ------------------- [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed through state terror and "private initiative", i.e. Chetnik plunder: ] Private initiative, too, can assist greatly in this direction. We should distribute weapons to our colonists, as need be. The old forms of Chetnik action should be organized and secretly assisted. [...] ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and, if need be, ascribed to economic reasons. Finally, local riots can be incited. These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the Chetniks, rather than the army. There remains one more means, WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL EFFECT AFTER 1878, that is, by secretly burning down Albanian villages and city quarters. (Emphasis above is mine.) These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually all Muslims during late 19th century. This policy of state terrorism against Muslims, aided by Chetnik "private initiative," has continued in WWII and today. For example, Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book "Od tradicije do identiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana" (Sarajevo: Svjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca in WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot, explaining their action as follows: "Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you are a Turk [i.e. Muslim]. And since you helped us, we shall not torture you." so the shot him instead of cutting his throat. In the past year, Serbs have repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca. Destruction of mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes the eradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs. >>I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda, >>in fact, for the past century or two, Croats and Muslims have seen >>themselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendly >>relations.

The last major battles between Austro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the end of the 17th century. Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism came into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic, who saw Bosnian Muslims as the best Croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations to Sarajevo? You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian nationalism here. Political nationalism has always been stronger. As for your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim alliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble. Arguments such as yours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split. > I should add few more things. A.J.

In international relations 101 you'll learn that unless weak unite to counterbalance the strong player, soon they are taken over and that's the end of them. Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats and Bosnian Muslims. This is only natural; all other alignments are unstable. I'm working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats and Muslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed. You are wrong if you think only "image" is at stake here. Croatia has a deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims, and vice versa. I think Tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice at this point. Tensions should have been defused better earlier, before any open confrontation developed. Although I still think Croatia will survive, it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse off. However, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not see it getting any worse. The key point is: do they still have any hope left? If not, then all bets are off. Mr. Stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this. I'm deeply hurt. This is not about some "image" but about survival of a concept of a partnership which I believe is natural and essential for both Croats and Muslims. Sigh... Josip	1

If Irgun had to attack civilian targets to terrorize in order that they might obtain some objective, I'm sure they would have done so. I also don't exclude Irgun's action against British soldiers as terrorism. The British were showing signs of favoring a compromise with regards to Palestine, and the Irgun and branch off groups made a point to kill young British recruits so that mothers and fathers back in Britain would get angry at Britains continued presence in Palestine. Sounds like a form of terrorism to me, and not much removed from Arab terrorism. We must not also forget that Irgun, or Irgun branch off groups [more likely] killed many jews who were not as hardline zionist as they, or who cooperated with the British. I'll reiterate again.... both sides are screwy, but I'll favor the underdog in this case because I do think they were a bit screwed.	1

Bosnian Muslims are slavic in ethnicity. They speak Serbo-Croatian. But there is a Christo-Slavic ideology whereby all true slavs are Christian and anyone who converted to Islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by changing religion. See the poems of Ngegos or the novels of Ivo Andric who brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls "the people" (i.e. Christian slavs). For this reason, the war-criminals call all the Bosnian Muslims "Turks" even though they are not ethnically Turk and do not speak Turkish as their first language. For this reason, what is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically identical but religiously "other" is called, paradoxically, "ethnic cleansing" rather than "religious cleansing." Thus, while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of WWII, and older agenda, the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from Bosnian, is being carried out under the cover of the Serbo-Croat war.

According to the CBO the United States has a force of about 88,000 US Army personel in Europe, I do not know if this includes a USMC division in Norway. They have available a little more than 500 USAF attack aircraft, including various models of the F-111, A-10, F-19A/B, and a few F-4s. {there are about 1,000 more of these available, SAFELY TUCKED AWAY AT HOME. At one time, the US maintained 1500 MBTs {about half were M1A1} but some of these were relocated to the Persian Gulf. I know the US has at LEAST one aircraft carrier battle group nearby and probably a marine assault brigade. Does anyone know if there are any B-52/B-1Bs in England?

A Serbian {who happened to be muslim}, stated that just a few months ago no vehicle even slowed for the boarder station. Now everyone is stopped and searched, many are turned back. Of course all I heard was a translators version, I do not speak Serbo-Croatian. If this is a effort on the part of Serbia & Montenegro {for whatever reason} to push the Boserbs into accepting the V-O, is this not a good thing? Peace, Jay Morris	1

Actually, the record of the Allies activities, in the face of incontrovertible evidence as to what the Nazis (may they rot in hell) were doing, clearly points to the conclusion that they would have done nothing. The railways to the camps were not bombed, despite the ease of doing so. The US, the "place of refuge" allowed in a bare pittance of Jews from Europe, primarily for public relations, so that the government could say it was "doing something". Many ships with refugees were turned away from US shores; some found refuge in Cuba or South America, many others sunk or had to return to Europe (with predictable consequences). The hope today is that we have collectively learned a lesson, and are less complacent to ignore other countries' "internal affairs". The sad reality is that this does not seem to be the case. -- Sean Philip (Shlomo) Engelson Yale Department of Computer Science Box 2158 Yale Station New Haven, CT 06520	1

No, I'm not claiming 2,000,000 have been killed. We are in the middle of the genocide process that Mr. Major has given yet another "green light" to. Mladic seems to have most of what he wants, but Boban is just getting his appetite whetted. Because Mladic refuses to allow international observers to inspect mass-grave sites and killing centers in places like Foca, Brcko, and Visegrad, it will be years before we have an accurate account of the number killed. In practical terms, it would be impossible to kill all 2,000,000. There just isn't the kind of machinery of crematoria and gas chambers and transportation lines that the Nazis took 8 YEARS to develop. And remember, the Nazis killed minorities in the countries they occupied. To actually kill 42% of the population requires extreme genocidal organization. But I do claim that the goal of the genocide is the systematic annihilation of Bosnian Muslim culture, by killing as many as is feasible, by rape, by torture, by the demolition of mosques, libraries, and culture artificts, the burning and renaming of villages, the shelling of civilians. So that there won't be any of the 2,000,000 or so Muslims whose lives have not been shattered by the genocide, though they still may be alive. And Mr. Major not only finds this acceptable, he helps it along by making sure that the victims don't have arms to defend themselves. > >-Nick > Mike. -- Michael Sells, Department of Religion, Haverford College Haverford, Pa 19041-1392	1

"Let's let the Serbs massacre, rape, and ethnically clean 100,000 Bosnians because we don't want our pretty blue berets there to get scratched". Well, I say, get them the hell out of there if you're worried for them, but don't deny Bosnians their basic right to self defense! Lift the embargo against Bosnia, and let them defend themselves. What makes the UN troops more valuable than the Bosnian people? They are letting the civilians die so the soldiers could survive, when if anything, it should be the other way around. Idiots like Owen expect Bosnians to swallow a forced plan, and just hope this problem will go away. Well they're wrong. If they had got their butts in gear (that is, if Bosnia had oil) a year ago, much of this could be prevented. Now, however, the results of this tragedy will last for generations. That's like forcing the jews to make peace with Hitler. Yeah right. This, as senator Biden said, reeks of bigotry, and makes me and any decent human being for that matter, quite sick. It should be the Europeans, not the Americans, who take the inititiative and ask the other for support. This is their backyard, not the Americans. Today it's Bosnia, tomorrow it will be Kosovo and Macedonia, Greece, and then Turkey, and the damn thing will spread. Not to mention European muslims who weren't even practicing before will rally to fundamentalism. Good luck handling that, your majesty! Owen was upset at the question which compared him to Chamberlain, who hoped to appease Hitler. He said that Chamberlain had been in Munich 2 years before any war, I have been here during a blazing war for the last 18 months. Well, that makes him even worse, because Chamberlain could have at least argued I'm giving Germany the benefit of the doubt, whereas Owen can't even do that. What the west is doing is aiding the Serbs by tying the Bosnians' hands, and making the stupid excuse of their powerless troops on the ground, who can't even protect the Bosnian foreign minister in their own armored vehicle, and watch the killers just walk away!

The whole "saddam is going to invade Saudi Arabia" was nothing but US State Department propeganda. Saddam (and Iraq in general) never recognised the British created Kuwait. They were trying to recover land they believed was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands. The Kuwaitis pushed just a little too far by taking Iraqi oil and Saddam thought he'd settle the dispute the old fashioned way... Everybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited Iraq together and concentrated on taking out Saddam. A strong, united Iraq with an elected government would have gone a long way to ridding the world of the feudal dictatorships in the Gulf. But of course a weak divided Arab people better suits US foriegn policy... The US had no problem killing tens of thousands of ill-equipted Iraqi soldiers, including burying several thousand alive and slaughtering retreating batallions from the air in defense of Kuwaiti oil, but it has yet to lift a finger against Bosnian Serbs while they slaughter Bosnian muslims....	1

My view is that Israel has made more gestures towards its Arab foes than the opposite. What have the Sysrians given to us or proposed? What have the Palestinians proposed? If the Palestinians would just revoke or rewrite their charter, or just condemn acts of Palestinian violence that would be a good start. The Palestinians have all to gain from these negotiations. Its seems though that they are not strong enough to make decisions on their own and are plagued by internal strife, that is why we are not getting anywhere. Fundamentalism is slowly taking over in the territories, then it will be too late to discuss issues with the Palestinians since they will only vow for the destruction of Israel.

Pick up a list of the Labor parties proposals for MK prior to the election and pay attention to the order. Correlate this with the number of Arab party members eligible to vote in party elections. Further correlate this with the voting results from Arab areas. Lo and behold, you will discover that Israeli Arab Labor party members did not band together unanimously or en large for a select group of Arab candidates. This problem is further exacerbated by the rifts between Israeli Arabs. Some claim membership to right wing parties while others vote for parties that do not pass the minimum cutoff. I worked within the labor party during the late 70's elections (not this last one) as a volunteer and was privy to the voting results that were returned from the local delegates elected. At the time, the system was structured differently but it did not cease to amaze me that there was no massive effort to lobby for Arab reps. by their own delegates. |> Exactly what basis do you have for saying this when the Labour party |> has never put an Arab into a Cabinet post and insists its coalition |> members do the same?

Friedman The Village Voice, May 11, 1993, Vol. XXXVIII No. 19 | How The Anti-Defamation League Turned the Notion | | of Human Rights on Its Head, Spying on Progress- | | ives and Funneling Information to Law Enforcement | Roy Bullock wanted to be a spy since he was a teenager in Indiana and read "I Led Three Lives," Herbert Philbrick's Cold War saga of penetrating the Communist Party for the FBI. Philbrick had become an American folk hero in the 1950s for building dossiers on unsuspecting colleagues. It was a time when Hollywood produced more than 30 films portraying the informer as the quintessential American patriot. In Boston, where Philbrick led three lives as an FBI informant, Communist Party member, and private citizen, the mayor even proclaimed a Herbert Philbrick Day and presented the spy with a plaque. For Bullock, a shy young man who was coming to terms with his homosexuality in the straight-arrow '50s, the life of a double agent was the perfect way to hide his lifestyle while fighting the Communist menace. "I was fascinated with Herbert Philbrick," Bullock recently told federal investigators, "and so I thought I would try to infiltrate the Communist Part. In 1957, I went to the Sixth World Youth and Student Festival in Moscow with the American delegation. I gave them [the FBI a full report on it when I returned, along with some photos I took of some Soviet military vehicles." Bullock was hooked. For the next two years, he worked as an unpaid informant for the FBI. But he found his true calling when he became a paid spy for the Anti-Defamation League in 1960. Now his activities are at the center of the biggest domestic spy scandal in recent American history -- a scandal that may end with the ADL's criminal indictment in San Francisco. Over a 30-year period, he compiled computer files for the ADL on 9876 individuals and more than 950 groups of all political stripes, including the NAACP, the Rainbow Coalition, ACLU, the American Indian Movement, the Center for Investigative Reporting, Pacifica, ACT UP, Palestinian and Arab groups, Sandinista solidarity groups, Americans for Peace Now, and anti-apartheid organizations. Bullock, who even spied on the recently slain South African nationalist Chris Hani when he visited the Bay Area in April 1991, sold many of his ADL files on anti-apartheid activists to South African intelligence. Meanwhile, between 1985 and 1993, the ADL paid him nearly $170,000, using a prominent Beverly Hills attorney as a conduit in order to conceal its financial relationship with Bullock. Last month, police raided ADL offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco, as well as Bullock's home, confiscating computer files and boxes of documents. According to court records, Bullock's files contained the driver's license and vehicle registration information, in addition to criminal histories on individuals -- much of which was allegedly stolen from the FBI and police computers. Bullock, 58, told the FBI that copies of virtually everything in his computer data base had been given to the San Francisco ADL office. "Based on the evidence," says Inspector Ron Roth, in a police affidavit, "I believe that Roy Bullock and ADL had numerous peace officers supplying them with confidential criminal and DMV information." What's more, the San Francisco D.A. is investigating Bullock for tapping phones, accessing answering machines, and assuming false identities to infiltrate organizations. Documents seized from Bullock's home also contained evidence of his forays into Bay Area trash cans: He had the names and phone numbers of employees at the Christic Institute in San Francisco, as well as telephone message slips to staff members (including names and phone numbers of callers), office correspondence listing the names and return addresses of the senders, and inter-office memos. He also had receipts from Christic Institute's bank accounts at Wells Fargo and Eureka Federal Savings, as well as itemized canceled checks with the names of the payees, the dates, and amounts. Bullock even knew the balance in the Christic Institute's checking account. Investigations by the FBI and police in San Francisco have revealed that the ADL has shared at least some of its spy gathering material with Israeli government officials. What's more, Israel apparently used tips from the ADL to detain Palestinian Americans who travelled there. * * * The ADL was established in New York City in 1913 to defend Jews, and later other minority groups, from discrimination. It led the fight against racist and fascist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party, and in the 1960s championed the civil rights movement. But there was also a darker side. In the late 1940s, the ADL spied on leftists and Communists, and shared investigative files with the House Committee on Un-American Activities and the FBI. The ADL swung sharply to the right during the Reagan administration, becoming a bastion of neoconservatism. To Irwin Suall, a repentant Trotskyite who heads the ADL's powerful Fact Finding Department, the real danger to Jews is posed not by the right -- but by a coalition of leftists, blacks, and Arabs, who in his view threaten the fabric of democracy in America, as well as the state of Israel. In the tradition of his ideological soulmate William Casey, Suall directed the ADL's vast network of informants, who were given code names like "Scumbag," "Ironside," and -- for a spy reportedly posing as a priest in Atlanta -- "Flipper." For years, journalists and liberal members of the Jewish community knew the ADL spied on right-wing hate groups. As long as the targets were anti-Semitic organizations like the Liberty Lobby and Lyndon Larouche, no one seemed to be particularly troubled. But the Bullock case reveals that the ADL also spied on groups that have a nonviolent, and progressive orientation. This apparent massive violation of civil liberties may end with the ADL's criminal indictment in San Francisco, where the investigation began. The human rights group faces possible criminal prosecution on as many as 48 felony counts, including an indictment for gaining illegal access to police computers. Says one source close to the West Coast investigation, "It is 99 per cent certain that the ADL will be indicted." In the wake of the San Francisco investigation, police probes of ADL spying are spreading to other parts of the country. "We have received numerous complaints about ADL [spying]," says Sam Adams, a spokesperson for the mayor's office in Portland, Oregon. On April 16, the Harlem-based Black United Fund of New York, and African American self-help group that Bullock allegedly spied on, wrote District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, requesting "an immediate investigation" of the ADL. "The ADL's actions cause great concern, as it is a direct and flagrant violation -- at minimum -- of our civil rights....We call upon you to join with the District Attorney of San Francisco to...bring and end to this latest form of McCarthyism." Gerald McKelvey, a spokesperson for Morgenthau's office, says, "We have no evidence before us that warrants any sort of investigation." McKelvey adds that Morgenthau offered to assist the FBI and the San Francisco D.A.'s office on their pending investigation. "They have not, so far, asked for our assistance." The ADL acknowledges sharing information on violence-prone groups with law enforcement officials. It also admits to maintaining extensive files on a wide variety of organizations, but says, in a two-page press release, "The vast majority of ADL's files are composed of news clips, magazine articles, books, journals, and other documents...." "ADL has made it clear that it does not and will not countenance violations of the law on the part of anyone connected with the agency, and the process by which the League gathers information is presently under review to insure that no laws are being violated." That's what the ADL says for public consumption. But morale is so low that its employees complain of sleepless nights and crying fits. And even as other Jewish groups circle the wagons around the ADL in a show of solidarity, many do so holding their noses. More than a few Jewish officials privately say the ADL has to decide whether it is a human rights group or a secret police agency. "The ADL is regarded both inside the Jewish community and outside the Jewish community as the definitive source of information on anti- Semitism and extremist groups," says Daniel Levitas, the former executive director of the Center for Democratic Renewal, an Atlanta- based group that monitors anti-Semitism, racism, and hate groups. "One of the things this scandal has done is that it has completely tainted the ADL's credibility and reputation with regard to its objectivity. This scandal is going to be a devastating blow to the Jewish community at large because people regard the ADL as synonymous with American Jewry." * * * Bullock's talents as a snoop and his extreme conservatism meshed well with the ADL's Cold War worldview. In 1960, he moved to Southern California where he became an ADL spy for $75.00 a week. Bullock almost always used his real name when snooping, although he once called himself Elmer Fink when corresponding with supporters of Alabama governor George Wallace. Bullock provided the ADL's office in Los Angeles with written reports, which were transmitted to Fact Finding Department head Irwin Suall, according to court records. Under Suall's stewardship, Fact Finding Department had become the ADL's heart and soul. Located at ADL national headquarters across from the United Nations, the department had assembled a vast library on "hate groups," culling material from publications, speeches, and informants reports. Bullock was more than adept at leading a double life. Not long after moving to California, he ingratiated himself with a woman in the John Birch Society who helped him gain access to the group's Boston office. There, he found a file the right-wingers were keeping on the ADL. The discovery gave rise to speculation in the ADL New York office that they had somehow been penetrated by the Birchers. Bullock focused almost exclusively on right-wing extremist groups until the early 1970s when ADL L.A. head Milton Sinn was replaced by Harvey Schechter, who encouraged him to target the left as well. A few years later, Bullock moved to the Castro District in San Francisco where he posed as an art dealer. And ADL fact finder who had infiltrated the local Arab community had just been exposed. When the ensuing scandal died down, Bullock was ordered by the ADL to penetrate the Arabs. The ADL was especially concerned about the American-Arab Anti- Discrimination Committee, founded by the former South Dakota senator James Abourezk to combat Arab-bashing. In a page out of the CIA's dirty tricks handbook on penetration and destabilization, Bullock joined the ADC, and then recruited Nazis into the group, apparently trying to discredit it, according to published reports. In 1987, the ADL sent Bullock to attend the National Association of Arab Americans annual congress in Washington. According to court documents, Bullock was told to find the source of the group's funds. Bullock was unable to "follow the money." But he did such a good job at ingratiating himself that he was appointed to head a NAAA delegation that visited Congress member Nancy Pelosi. It's not surprising that the ADL penetrated Arab organizations. But only acute paranoia explains their interest in groups like ACT UP. As far as Bullock was concerned, gay groups in San Francisco were heavily infiltrated by what he called "gay left revolutionaries," prompting him to write about their activities for the ADL. Bullock soon expanded his horizons, moving into the shadowy realm of foreign espionage after Richard Hirschhaut, the head of ADL's San Francisco office, introduced him to Thomas Gerard in 1986. Gerard was then a detective with the San Francisco Police Department's Intelligence Unit. Gerard had worked as a demolitions expert for the CIA in El Salvador in the early 1980s, where he apparently had more than a passing interest in right-wing death squads. (Police searching Gerard's briefcase found extensive CIA literature about torture and interrogation, photos of blindfolded and chained men, as well as passports made out to Gerard in 10 different names, including Thomas Clouseau. From a remote jungle island redoubt in the Philippines where he fled last November, Gerard told the Los Angeles Times that he will blow the lid off the CIA's involvement with Latin American death squads if he is indicted in the ADL spy case.) After their very first encounter in the ADL office, Gerard and Bullock had lunch at McDonald's, "I liked Tom right off," Bullock later told a San Francisco police investigator whose report of the interrogation was obtained by the _Voice_. "Tom is a very charming, roguish character, with a great deal of integrity. Let me say here, I consider Tom Gerard one of the finest policemen I've ever worked with, absolutely. Honest, capable, intelligent and 100 percent American." Before long, Bullock was providing Gerard with confidential ADL reports on various groups and individuals. In turn, Gerard gave Bullock classified police intelligence files on local Arab Americans, skinheads, and others. Bullock told the FBI that Gerard's material ended up in his ADL reports. "I would say 99 percent of the data that I got was name, address, and sometimes physical description. Criminal history, very rarely," Bullock told investigators. Gerard also gave Bullock a chart that outlined a vast network of Bay Area Arab American businessmen and organizations that allegedly has ties to Middle East terror groups, as well as surveillance photos of Arab Americans receiving weapons training overseas. Bullock claims that U.S. Customs in New York gave Gerard the photos. "It was understood that Bullock would be very careful with what he did with the information Gerard gave him, and that Bullock would not release it except to the ADL or other law enforcement officers," says an FBI report. There was nothing unusual about Bullock's cozy relationship with law enforcement. By the mid-1980s, the ADL was swapping files with hundreds of "official friends," the organization's euphemism for U.S. law enforcement and intelligence sources. The ADL's relationship with the FBI's counterterrorism office was so close that ADL's reports on Arab American group's covert ties to Middle East terrorists were "must reading." It's no accident that police found a 1986 classified FBI report entitled "Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)--New York Area" while searching the ADL's San Francisco office. In 1987, ADL spooks investigated seven Palestinians and a Kenyan studying in California universities on student visas. When the ADL discovered they were disseminating PFLP literature, it informed the FBI, which in turn took the case to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. After the INS ordered the students deported as subversives, ADL regional director David Lehrer gloated in the _Los Angeles Times_ about his office's cooperation with law enforcement, although he's backpedaling now. The "Los Angeles 8" deportation is still under appeal. * * * While the ADL worked quietly with America's top cops, it enjoyed similar ties with Israel's spy agencies -- a charge that ADL leaders vehemently deny. But as early as July 7, 1961, ADL director Benjamin Epstein wrote to B'nai B'rith executive secretary Saul Joftes, requesting $25,000 for his investigators. "Our information," he boasted to Joftes, "in addition to being essential for our own operations, has been of great value and service to both the United States Department and the Israeli Government. All data have been made available to both countries with full knowledge to each that we are the source." In 1987, the ADL came under FBI scrutiny in the wake of the Pollard spy scandal. While assigned to the Navy's Anti-Terrorist Alert Center, where he had access to the most closely guarded U.S. secrets, Jonathan Pollard stole thousands of pages of classified documents for Israel, which, according to federal prosecutors, "could fill a room the size of a large closet...ten feet by six feet by six feet." Pollard's handler was Avi Sella, an Israeli air force colonel whose wife worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer. Pollard later wrote to friends that a prominent ADL leader was deeply involved in the Israeli spy operation. While there is no proof that anyone connected with the ADL was involved with Pollard, there is evidence that the ADL freely passes information to Israeli intelligence. In March 1993, the FBI interrogated David Gurvitz, an ADL fact finder in Los Angeles until 1992 when he was fired by Suall for illegally obtaining police information to use against a rival at the Simon Wiesenthal Center. The FBI pointedly asked Gurvitz if he had ever transmitted information to Israel. Gurvitz admitted that in 1992 he had learned from a law enforcement contact that Michael Elias, allegedly a member of a radical PLO faction, was scheduled to travel from San Francisco International Airport en route to Haifa. Gurvitz phoned the deputy Israeli consul general in L.A. with the information. "Later the same day," according to a 15-page FBI interview of Gurvitz obtained by the _Voice_, "Gurvitz was called back by another man, who said he was from the Israeli Consulate, and who asked Gurvitz to repeat the information about Elias. Gurvitz did not get this man's name, but their conversation was in Hebrew so Gurvitz felt confident the man was actually an Israeli Consulate official." Among the 12,000 names of private citizens that police found in ADL files in San Francisco was Mohammed Jarad, a 36-year-old Chicago resident who was arrested in Israel on January 25, for allegedly distributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hamas, the large Islamic fundamentalist movement in the Occupied Territories. The Chicago ADL office runs at least three undercover informants who work with "official friends" in local law enforcement, according to documents released by the San Francisco D.A. and sources close to the ADL. Given these facts, Arab American groups surmise that the ADL has passed information on Jarad to Israeli intelligence. One technique used by the ADL to monitor the large Arab American community in the Midwest was to scan the local Arab press for funeral notices. According to sources familiar with the practice, ADL investigators in unmarked vans videotaped the Palestinian funerals, which sometimes turned into PLO rallies. Palestinians have been detained at Ben-Gurion Airport simply on the basis of having been filmed attending a funeral in Chicago, according to Suhail Miari, the executive director of the United Holy Land Fund, whose cousin was an Arab member of Israel's Knesset. Shortly after Jarad was arrested, the Israeli government announced that Hamas was being run from America with money and operational instructions relayed by courier or fax. Israel's charges were played up on the front page of _The New York Times_. According to well- placed sources, Yehudit Barsky, an ADL fact finder in New York, worked closely with Israeli officials on this campaign of vilification, introducing "friendly" reporters to "official friends" in Chicago law enforcement. Barsky, who is fluent in Arabic, prepared an ADL report about how Hamas is funded in America. She identified the Dallas-based Islamic association for Palestine in North America as the front organization for Hamas in the U.S.A. "Its infrastructure functions as an interlocking network of organizations, small businesses, and individual activists," says the February 1993 ADL report, which outlines the organization's development, its activities on U.S. college campuses, and its "metamorphosis" during the Gulf War. It also traces Hamas fundraising through a plethora of alleged front- groups from Plainfield, Indiana, to Culver City, California. It is doubtful that Barsky could have compiled such sophisticated data without the help of "official friends" and ADL spies. Barsky refused to comment. But she used to talk to Greg Slabodkin as many as three times a week when he was an opposition researcher for AIPAC, whose spy operation was disclosed last summer in the _Voice_. "The level of cooperation was very close," Slabodkin said during a recent phone conservation from Israel where he is in graduate school. "If we felt our files were lacking, we contacted the ADL." When Sha'wan Jabarin, a 30-year-old Palestinian human rights worker in the Occupied Territories won a $25,000 Reebok Human Rights Award in 1990, Slabodkin recalls that Barsky faxed AIPAC the man's entire police file, which she had obtained from the Israeli embassy. Jabarin had been arrested numerous times in Israel, and once confessed to being a member of the PLO after having been severely tortured. Jabarin, who received a short jail term, became an Amnesty International Prisoner of Conscience. Of course, to AIPAC and the ADL, Jabarin was a terrorist. Slabodkin, who was ordered to keep tabs on him when he was in the U.S. to receive his award, called a representative of Al Haq, the Palestinian human rights group that employed Jabarin, to obtain his itinerary. AIPAC even opened a file on musician Jackson Browne, who presented Jabarin with the Reebok award. While the ADL may be able to rationalize its close monitoring of Arabs, and even left-wing gay revolutionaries, it has a far harder time explaining its obsession with spying on anti-apartheid activists. David Gurvitz told the FBI that when he started working as a fact finder for the ADL in L.A. in March 1989, ADL files already bulged with information about the Israel-South African connection and anti- apartheid groups. "Gurvitz confirmed that the ADL did routinely collect information on persons engaged in anti-apartheid activities in the United States," says the FBI report. While Gurvitz said there were files in the L.A. ADL office dating to the 1930s, he estimated the oldest material on anti-apartheid activities dates back to the late 1970s, paralleling Begin's rise to power in Israel and a deepening of ties between the Jewish state and South Africa. "In about August, 1992," says the report of the FBI's March 3, 1993, interview with Gurvitz, "an anti-apartheid demonstration was held at the South African Consulate in Los Angeles. Participating in the demonstration were the Los Angeles Student Coalition and the Socialist Workers Party. Gurvitz went to two demonstration planning sessions, and a subsequent demonstration. He wrote a report for the ADL on each of the planning sessions and on the demonstration. Copies of the reports were disseminated to Bullock, among others, in care of the San Francisco ADL office." In 1986 Bullock learned that the consul general of the South African Consulate in Los Angeles would be speaking in Las Vegas at a meeting organized by Willis Carto, the head of the anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby. "Suspecting that the Consul General did not know who Willis Carto is," says the FBI report, "Bullock suggested to Gerard that they might want to warn the South Africans. Gerard agreed and informed the Consul General, who canceled his appearance." A few months later, Gerard phoned Bullock and told him a South African intelligence officer wanted to meet them. During a rendezvous in a hotel near Fisherman's Wharf, the South African said he was interested in acquiring information on American anti-apartheid activists. The South African, who called himself Mr. Humphries, also asked for information about groups that were advocating divestments. "Gerard, who was present throughout the meeting," says the FBI report, "told Humphries that he [Gerard] had been employed by the CIA....Humphries offered to pay Bullock $150.00 per month in exchange for information. Bullock noted that much of the information Humphries said he wanted was already in the possession of Bullock and the ADL." Between 1987 and 1991, Bullock sold information to South African intelligence, receiving steady raises, which he split evenly with Gerard. "Bullock said it was his impression, though Gerard never explicitly told him so, (and Bullock never asked) that Gerard may have been telling the CIA about his and Bullock's contacts with the South Africans," says the FBI report. "Gerard had said he knew the CIA 'resident agent' in San Francisco....Once, after Gerard dropped Bullock off at Bullock's residence following a meeting with Louie [who replaced Humphries as their handler], Gerard said he was going to go to the San Francisco CIA office." Al the while, Gerard may have been "tasking" Bullock for the CIA. "Bullock recalled that once, after he had met Gerard, Bullock went to Chicago, Illinois to conduct an investigation on behalf of the ADL," says the FBI report. "The target of the investigation was a group called the Palestine Human Rights Campaign. Bullock learned that a woman [name deleted] was transporting money between the PLO or the PFLP, and the United States. Bullock told this to Gerard. Gerard later told Bullock that Gerard's 'guy at the CIA' would like to know more. Gerard asked Bullock if Bullock would go back to Chicago to gather more information on the Palestine Human Rights Campaign. Bullock, however, never did go back." Gerard also seems to have had a close relationship with Mossad, which may have started in 1991 when he went on an ADL junket to Israel. The ADL frequently sponsors trips for American law enforcement officials to Israel, where they are wined and dined and meet their counterparts in various intelligence agencies. According to an affidavit by San Francisco police inspector Roth, the "all-expense paid trip [to Israel] was more or less a thank-you gift and a liaison gesture by the ADL to continue the close relationships it has with specific law enforcement officers from the United States." Gerard may have liked what he saw in Israel. A short time after travelling there, he went to Addis Ababa where he helped with Mossad's rescue of Ethiopian Jews. As Gerard's relationship with South Africa deepened, he talked more openly about his exploits in the CIA. "Bullock recalled Gerard mentioning that he had been in Algeria on CIA business, and that Gerard discussed the PLO and 'safehouses,'" says the FBI report, "To this Louie once responded that Israeli intelligence had determined that the PLO and the African National Congress were cooperating. Gerard also spoke of having travelled with the CIA to Afghanistan.... Louie also [told Gerard and Bullock] about his adventures inside South Africa as an intelligence officer. Both Gerard and Louie traded 'war stories' and regaled each other and Bullock with tales of 'narrow scrapes.'" Although there is still much mystery about what triggered law enforcement's investigation of the ADL, it was probably the theft of a classified FBI report on the Nation of Islam from the FBI's San Francisco office. Police armed with search warrants recovered the report in the ADL San Francisco office. Gurvitz says he had sent a copy of it to Mira Boland, the director of the ADL's fact finding division in Washington, D.C. Boland was preparing an op-ed piece for _The Washington Times_, in which she argued that the Nation of Islam should not receive federal funds for the reconstruction of L.A. because the group is anti-Semitic and violence-prone. (Boland, who had arranged the ADL police junket to Israel attended by Gerard, testified in a 1990 criminal trial in Roanoke, Virginia, that she had worked for the CIA for 14 months and later was a subcontractor for the Defense Department before joining the ADL. During the trial, Boland admitted to sharing information with a CIA official at an invitation- only ADL conference.) After he was questioned by the FBI last fall, Gerard fled to the Philippines, which has no extradition treaty with America. Gerard is believed to have supplied information from police computers not only to the ADL, but to Israel and South Africa as well. The _San Francisco Examiner_ reported that Gerard may be charged with violating federal espionage laws. Although Bullock worked for the ADL for 30 years, and Irwin Suall praised him in a July 1992 memo as "our number one investigator," the ADL now argues that he was a rogue agent. In its own defense, the ADL also asserts that its fact finders operate no differently than journalists. After all, ask ADL officials, don't journalists keep files? But the difference between the practice of journalism and the ADL's method of gathering information couldn't be more striking. Journalists place information in the public domain where they are held accountable for falsehoods, distortions, and libel. And for the most part, journalists don't share their investigative files with foreign and domestic police agencies. The ADL has no such inhibition. Because many of its files are not open to public scrutiny, false information collected by ideologically biased researchers cannot be corrected. Once a proud human rights group, the ADL has become the Jewish thought police. "The ADL says it's a human rights group not just for Jews but for everyone," says Chip Berlet, a highly respected researcher at the Massachusetts-based Political Research Associates, which monitors right-wing extremist groups. "That's fine but it can't do that and spy on Palestinians. It's blatantly unethical and frankly immoral." "My argument to people is that the ADL wears four hats. Each of the hats independently is appropriate. It is a broad-based human rights group that looks at the broad issues of prejudice and discrimination. It is a group that defends Jews against defamation. Entirely noble. Nothing wrong with that hat. It is a group, whose leaders, at least, consistently defend the actions of Israel against its critics, which again is entirely appropriate. And it is a group that maintains an information-sharing arrangement with law enforcement. Again, there is nothing wrong for a group to do that." "But you can't do all four. It is impossible to do all four and not violate the bounds of ethics. There's a built-in conflict of interest if you wear all four hats." ADL national director Abraham Foxman apparently sees no such conflict. In a September 1, 1992, letter to the _Voice_, Foxman complained: "ADL has a proud 80-year record of fighting bigotry and promoting civil rights and constitutional freedoms. Any imputation of an effort or motive on our part to smear or stifle the free speech of anyone is false and baseless" "Throughout his pieces [on AIPAC's spying], Friedman describes the dissemination of information as if it were slander, and the existence of files as a token of McCarthyite inclination. The depiction is misleading in several ways. Virtually every journalist, academic, politician and organization keeps files on subjects they deem relevant; tracing the logic of Friedman's reckless charges, the Library of Congress is tantamount to the KGB. Moreover, disseminating the public record of a public figure is neither defamation nor McCarthyism." But many believe the ADL is increasingly in the defamation business. Ask Jesse Jackson, James Abourezk, or the leaders of the New Jewish Agenda -- all past targets of ADL smears. (At the same time, the ADL exonerated the fascist World Anti-Communist League, which assisted Ronald Reagan's covert war against Nicaragua, a policy endorsed by ADL leaders.) In the early 1980s, researchers Russ Bellant and Berlet asked to meet fact finding head Irwin Suall, to discuss their work on anti-Semite Lyndon LaRouche. "Our view then of Irwin Suall was that he was this really terrific investigator," says Berlet. "So we introduce ourselves, say what we are up to and Suall leans back in his chair and basically runs down a dossier on each of us: about what our political activities are, who we work with, what organizations we belong to. Obviously, he was just trying to blow us away and he succeeds admirably. We were just sitting there with our mouths open feeling very uncomfortable." "And then he leans forward and says, 'The right-wing isn't the problem. The left-wing is the problem. The Soviet Union is the biggest problem in the world for Jews. It's the American left that is the biggest threat to American Jews. You're on the wrong track. You're part of the problem.' We were stunned. I was virtually in tears. This is not how I perceived myself. We basically stumbled out of there in a daze." ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Letters (response to Friedman's article) The Village Voice, May 18, 1993, Vol. XXXVIII No. 20 A LEAGUE OF HIS OWN Robert I. Friedman's assault on the Anti-Defamation League [The Anti- Defamation League Is Spying On You." May 11] demonstrates that he has an axe to grind and his own prejudiced and biased agenda to promote. It also demonstrates that concern for accurate reporting is far down on his list. The story is replete with inaccuracies, innuendos, and outright falsehoods, and conveys a picture of ADL so divorced from reality as to be farcical. Friedman is even wrong on such basic, easily determined facts as where ADL was founded (Chicago, not New York) and the building in which ADL'S San Francisco office is located (not the Jewish Community Federation building pictured). ADL has done the work of fighting haters for 80 years, without "spying" on organizations or individuals and with profound respect for the law. Our mission is to monitor and expose those who are anti- Jewish, racist, anti-democratic, and violence-prone, and we monitor them primarily by reading publications and attending public meetings. Through the years, we have published scores of reports on anti- Semitism emanating from both the left and the right. In fact, although Friedman's bias leads him to assume the contrary, ADL's primary concern is still the far right. Because extremist organizations are highly secretive, sometimes ADL can learn of their activities only by using undercover sources. Friedman's hyperbole notwithstanding, these sources function in a manner directly analogous to investigative journalists. Some have performed great service to the American people -- for example, by uncovering the existence of right-wing extremist paramilitary training camps -- with no recognition and at considerable personal risk. The information ADL obtains is placed in the public domain, and through the years ADL has established a reputation for accurate reporting. Friedman's article, by contrast, contains so much misinformation that it would take an article equally as long to set the record straight. A few examples: He states that an "ADL leader was deeply involved in the [Jonathan Pollard] Israeli spy operation," and that Pollard's handler's wife "worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer." Not true. Friedman also states: "ADL investigators in unmarked vans videotaped Palestinian funerals." Not true. Elsewhere, he asserts that ADL was obsessed "with spying on anti-apartheid activists." Again, not true. We could go on and on -- and, of course, Friedman does not reveal *his* sources. The distortion games Friedman plays when he mentions numbers further reveal his lack of objectivity. When it comes to how much ADL paid Roy Bullock a week -- as an independent contractor, not an employee (an important distinction Friedman also fails to make) -- he includes the zeros ($75.00, $150.00), inviting the reader to see a large number. By contrast, when he observes that ADL paid Bullock "nearly $170,000" between 1985 and 1993, he chooses not to point out that amounts to little more than $20,000 a year -- hardly an excessive sum. What is accurate about Friedman's story is Chip Berlet's description of ADL's four hats. Yes, ADL looks at broad issues of prejudice and discrimination. Yes, ADL defends Israel against critics. And yes, ADL maintains an information-sharing relationship with law enforcement regarding extremist activities and hate crimes. We see no conflict in these four activities, and we believe most _Voice_ readers won't either. ABRAHAM FOXMAN National Director Anti-Defamation League Manhattan ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ROBERT I. FRIEDMAN REPLIES: For the ADL to compare itself to investigative journalists is absurd. Journalists don't spy on Arabs and anti-apartheid activists and then freely pass their files to South African and Israeli intelligence. But according to police the confessions of two paid ADL investigators, buttressed by 700 pages of court documents and interviews, the ADL does. Indeed, the ADL spies on groups that are neither anti-Semitic nor violent. Police confiscated ADL files on hundreds of mainstream groups ranging from ACT UP to Peace Now. Respected intellectuals and Middle East scholars who disagree with the ADL's political views have ended up on ADL blacklists, their reputations smeared. "Private organizations have no business paying operatives inside police departments or having spies," says an April 17 editorial in the _St. Louis Post-Dispatch_, condemning ADL spying. On April 10, police armed with search warrants raided ADL offices in San Francisco and L.A. after concluding that "ADL employees were apparently less than truthful" in voluntarily turning over documents during an earlier search, according to San Francisco police inspector Ron Roth's sworn affidavit. Roth also asserts that Bullock was a "paid employee for the ADL." If so, by failing to pay taxes on $170,000 of income paid to Bullock, the ADL could face a total of 48 felony counts, according to court papers. The ADL may also face felony charges for illegally obtaining confidential information from police computers. As for errors: The ADL was founded in Chicago, and moved to New York in 1947. But it was an original tenant in the San Francisco building shown in the _Voice_ photo, moving out a few months ago. I never wrote that an "ADL leader was deeply involved in the [Pollard] Israeli spy operation." I reported that Pollard himself made the charge. And in court papers, Pollard's own lawyer said that the wife of Pollard's handler worked for the ADL. If I have a bias, it is on the side of the First and Fourth Amendments.	1

During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland. The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

As "Azerbaijan" newspaper informs, the issue of attraction of western investments in Azerbaijan was discussed in the meeting. In particular, Gulyiev stated that western capital has to be investigated in the most profitable spheres of manufacture. He also noticed, that the number of the priority manufactures will be released from debts. Guliyev also said that intensifying the activities of the American oil companies will promote the strengthening of the American-Azeri relations. THE PROPOSAL TO SUMMON SPECIAL SESSION OF THE SUPREME SOVIET IS REJECTED AGAIN Baku (May 19) Turan: Yesterday, in the sitting of the Milli Mejlis, the chairman, Isa Gambar, rejected the proposal of the deputy Arif Rahimzade to summon a special session of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan. This written proposal to summon a session was signed by 130 deputates. But the chairman said that the signatures were invalid and the proposal couldn't be submitted for discussion. Earlier, the leadership of the Milli Mejlis called the proposal to summon a special session of the Supreme Soviet a coup attempt. But the deputy for the Parliament, Rahimzade, doesn't consider that the deputates have the objective of removing Milli Mejlis and its chairman from the power. It concerns the serious analysis of the social, economic and foreign policy activity of the republic's authority. Rahimzade said that the deputates for the Parliament, ejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinion on these questions. The Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan (340 deputates) was dissolved one year ago, when it attempted to bring Ayaz Mutalibov back to the power. The functions of S.S. were handed over to Milli Mejlis, consisting of 50 deputates (25 "democrats" and 25 "partocrates"). At that time "democrats" and "partocrates" came to an agreement that Milli Mejlis wouldn't exist for a long time and would be dissolved after parliamentary elections. At the same time, the deputates ejected from their duties were guaranteed that they could summon a session of the Supreme Soviet any time and went in for political activity out of the Parliament. --0-- THE PROSPECTS OF TRADE/ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN AND ESTONIA Baku (May 19) Turan: The prospects of signing trade-economic agreement between Azerbaijan and Estonia were discussed in the meeting of the Foreign Minister Tofig Gasimov with the group of experts of the Ministry of Economics, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Estonian Bank administration on May 18. The group of experts is headed by Tikht Reiman, the chief of the Ministry of Economics of Estonia. The MIA of Azerbaijan informed Turan agency, that in their stay in Baku, the delegation will also visit Ministry of Economics and National Bank of the republic.--0-- AZERBAIJAN DOES NOT INTEND TO JOIN THE CIS COMMON ECONOMIC ZONE Baku (May 19) Turan: Deputy prime-ministers of the republic, Vahid Ahmedov and Abbas Abbasov declared that Azerbaijan wouldn't join the CIS common economic zone. Vahid Ahmedov considers that the CIS economic zone proposal to create a common tax system contradicts independent economic policy of the republic. According to Abbas Abbasov, the pact of cooperation proposals, submitted for the discussion of the leaders of CIS states in Moscow on May 14, has a number of unfavorable points for Azerbaijan. Such announcements of two deputy prime-ministers sound sensational on the background of the fact that the president of Azerbaijan and the chairman of the Parliament noted the necessity of the republic on joining the CIS economic zone.--0-- THE QUESTIONS OF GRANTING CREDIT TO AZERBAIJAN WILL BE DISCUSSED IN MOSCOW Baku (May 19) Turan: Today, Azerbaijani delegation headed by the director of the foreign relation department of the Ministry of Finance of the republic along with the representatives of the National Bank will leave for Moscow to hold consultation with Russian government on granting credit to Azerbaijan. According to the preliminary information, the credit will be 50 billion rubles. As press-centre of Ministry of Finance informed Turan's correspondent, precise amount of the credit, conditions of its repay and a number of other questions of mutual interest will be discussed in the course of the meeting in Moscow. It is known that this credit will be mostly used for mutual settling of industrial enterprises of Azerbaijan and Russia. When the sides reach the agreement, it is proposed for signing by the end of May.--0-- AZERBAIJAN WILL REPLY TO THE SECOND VARIANT OF TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BY 26 OF MAY Baku (May 19) Turan: On the measures for peace presented by Russia, Turkey and the USA to Azerbaijan and Armenia, the representative of the president of Azerbaijan in the talks on Nagorno-Karabakh, Asim Gasimov noted that the plan was not seriously changed in comparison with the first variant. "Just some comments to several points were added to the schedule by insistence of the Armenian side. We do not intend to come back to the analysis of the schedule, because we have given a positive answer to it on May 6",- said Gasimov. The representative of the president of Azerbaijan informed that they just began to work on the examination of the commentary, and their answer would be given as requested by the authors of trilateral initiative by May 26. As it is known, the first variant of the peace measures was rejected by Armenia, which put forward a number of pre-conditions for its acceptance.--0-- THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PROSECUTOR OF THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The Azerbaijani prosecutor's office has announced that the Russian mass media's attempt to portray the 6 Russian soldiers condemned by the military board of the Azerbaijani Supreme Court, as innocent people is unjustified. Accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves, prove that their crimes were committed together with the Armenian military units and with the knowledge of the headquarters of the Russian army unit, where they served. The announcement points out that the attempts to represent these soldiers as ordinary mercenaries who have nothing to do with the Russian army are also unfounded. For there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on the list of one of the military unit's of Russian commandos in Yerevan. Certain Russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation of the Russian army in the undeclared war of Armenia against Azerbaijan from the Russian community. Azerbaijan's prosecutor's announcement follows, that this type of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated.--0-- AZERBAIJAN'S PARLIAMENT INTENDS TO APPEAL TO RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT REGARDING THE SIX ACCUSED SOLDIERS BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed, parliament of Azerbaijan is considering the question of appealing to Russian parliament about the six accused soldiers' fortune. In particular, the offer to send the representatives of the Commission on military affairs of the armed forces of Russian Federation to Baku for the detailed study of the results of six Russian soldiers' case will be directed to Russian parliament. According to one of the supporters of this offer, such initiative will give Russian parliament the possibility to be convinced of the correctness of the investigation. There will also be a chance to discuss the reasons that have given rise to the present situation - that is the Russian troops participation in the war against Azerbaijan. ARMENIANS ARE PREPARING MORE "KARABAKHS" ON THE NORTH CAUCASUS BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The National-liberation front founded by group of Armenians living on the North Caucasus appealed to establish Armenian autonomies on the territories of Rostov, Stavropol and Krasnodar regions, - reported the newspaper "Russky vestnik" on March 9, 1993 published in Geneva. The North Caucasus is regarded as an integral part of Armenia in the documents of this organization. Admitting the non-realizability of "reunion" of the North Caucasus and "Armenia proper" at present, the front is appealing to the UN, presidents of Russia, Armenia and the United States to consider the need to establish Armenian autonomies on the Caucasus. To attain these goals, the Armenian organization considers it necessary to carry out on the North Caucasus the forms and methods of activity "identical to those in Nagorno Karabakh". Besides the decision to fund cells of Armenian national-liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders of Armenian terrorist groups in Greece and Iran to sent to the North Caucasus instructors for training of Armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted. Thus according to the newspaper "Russky vestnik", "new Karabakhs" are being planning on the North Caucasus. --O-- STATE ASSISTANCE FOR NATIONAL MINORITY DEVELOPMENT BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The meeting headed by the State secretary of Azerbaijan, Ali Kerimov, with the participation of the national cultural centers was held in Baku. The first results of the realization of the president Elchibey's decree on state assistance for the development of language and culture of national minorities adopted on September 16, 1992 were considered. The State secretary called this decree as an important step to establish a legal democratic state. He confirmed once more the commitment of the leadership of Azerbaijan to set up a democratic society in which the rights of all nationalities and ethnic groups would be respected. The State Counsellor of the president of Azerbaijan on the national policy, Hidayat Orujev, announced that in spite of the difficulties of the "undeclared war" against the republic, the leaders of the state managed to solve many problems concerning the satisfaction of cultural and other needs of the ethnic groups. For today, all 33 national-cultural centers registered by the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Azerbaijan are provided with accommodation, furniture and means of communication. All the accommodations are rent-free ( 8 foreign diplomatic missions in Baku are placed in the hotels because of the absence of free accommodations including the representation of the UN General secretary). As it was noted, a great work was carried out since the decree was adopted to create conditions for total development of the ethnic groups. On the North of Azerbaijan where Lezghins live, a national Lezghin theater was opened, radiocast is transmitted in Lezghin. The work over the creation of the educational literature for Talyshs, Tats, Lezghins and Kurds and national teaching and scientific staff is being carried out in the Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan.--O-- MEMORANDUM OF COOPERATION ON EXTRACTING OIL-GAS FIELDS OF AZERBAIJAN WAS SIGNED BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed in the State concern "Azerineft", the Memorandum of understanding with the companies "AMOCO Caspian Sea Petroleum", "Bi-Pi Exploration Operating", "Pennzoil Caspian", "Unocal Khazar Ltd.", "McDermott" and Turkish oil corporation on mutual extracting of fields "Azeri", "Chirag" and "Gyuneshli" was signed. According to the memorandum, the general group on preparing of a common program of activity was created. According to the president of "Azerineft", Sabit Bagirov, cooperation will provide for using the experience of foreign companies more efficiently. During the project, the main principles will be the effective use of oil-gas resources, the rational sharing of investments, the reducing of exploitation expenditures and maximizing the profit of Azerbaijan from the exploitation of these fields. The memorandum also envisions the necessity to take into account the historical and political-economical interests of Azerbaijan under optimum use of oil-gas fields. --O-- ARMENIA TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROSECUTION OF SIX RUSSIAN SOLDIERS BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: After Azerbaijani court passed sentence on six Russian soldiers fighting on the Armenian side in Karabakh, Armenian propaganda has become actively involved. The Armenians living in Russia appealed to the president Yeltsin with a request "to display firmness in asserting the rights of Russian soldiers". At the same time, Armenian mass media call legal proceedings on the case in Baku as "a farce aimed at getting more arms from Russia". The Karabakh Armenians have issued a threat recently. If one could believe the Yerevan agency "Snark", the Armenians in Karabakh presented an ultimatum to authorities in Azerbaijan. The essence of this ultimatum is that if Russian soldiers are not shown mercy, three Azeri prisoners in Karabakh will be shot dead. It is simple to explain such "touching attitude of Armenians" to the six Russian soldiers' fate. If by chance the sentence is executed it will cause not anti-Azeri but anti-Armenian reaction, as the accused Russian soldiers were recruited in Yerevan by the former Defence Minister of Armenia and then transferred to Karabakh. If the soldiers get mercy, Armenian side will think highly of its saving of lives of "innocent Russians". --O-- NEW PROVOCATIONS OF ARMED FORCES OF ARMENIA BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: According to the Defence Ministry of Azerbaijan on May 20-21, the firing on the territories of Azerbaijan from the military bases on the territory of Armenia was in progress. The day before, the villages of Kolly-Gyshlag, Shotaraz, Nyachaflar of Zangelan district of Azerbaijan were under fire from Kafan district of Armenia. Two inhabitants were wounded, there were destructions in the villages. On May 20, the firing on the villages of Bashkend, Mutudere, Shynykh, Novosaratovka and Novoivanovka of Kedabek district of Azerbaijan from the positions of Armenian armed forces was in progress. At the same day the diversion group of the armed forces of Armenia (50-60 men) violated the frontier of Azerbaijan, penetrated into the territory of Kedabek district of Azerbaijan, killed two shepherds at the village of Aili-Dara and made an attempt to take a flock across the frontier. Azeri frontier-guards stopped the enemy.--O-- "UNOCAL" COMPANY WILL BUILD 50 HOUSES FOR REFUGEES IN AZERBAIJAN BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed by the representation of UNOCAL American oil company, the leaders of this company decided to give 750 thousand dollars for the construction of 50 houses for refugees. At present, the American side suggested a village project for consideration by appropriate departments of Azerbaijan. The project is a farm village where each house has a personal lot, subsidiary accommodations and so on. According to the program the construction and putting into operation of the village will be this year. --O-- MANAT IS BEGINNING TO FALL IN VALUE BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: Lately, at the black market of Baku, the national currency - Manat, fell in price compared with the Russian Ruble. Thus one gives 1100 Rubles or 120 Manats for one US dollar. Taking into account the official exchange-value of the Manat with respect to Ruble which is 1-10, the national currency fell in value 10 percent. Meanwhile the exchange-value of the Manat to the Ruble is the same at banks, state establishments and in trade. According to the representatives of the business circles and experts, the present situation is explained by the fact that the rubles are bought by the local businessmen. They need rubles for financial operations in Russia. As the remittance of payments from the republics of the former USSR to Russia is a great problem now, many businessmen arrange deals in cash. Taking into consideration the volume of business with Russia, counted by billions, it is not hard to imagine how much Rubles in cash the businessmen need. --O-- THE DISCUSSION OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION BILL WILL LAST TILL MID JULY Baku (May 22) Turan: According to the president's decree, the expert group, including representatives of the Parliament and presidential apparatus, are working out new wording of the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan. This must be adopted by Milli Mejlis before the Parliamentary elections. Together with this, the work on the new Constitution, that would be, evidently, adopted by new Parliament of the country, is going on. The newsmen were informed about the work on the press-conference of the Supreme Soviet of the republic the day before. Parliamentary legal experts, Safa Mirzoyev, Simran Hasanov and representatives of the department of the president's apparatus Fazil Mustafaev and Shahin Aliev took part in the press-conference. The national discussion of the project of the Parliamentary election law is going on at present. According to Simran Hasanov the bill didn't cause any objections. It was noted, that until now, no alternative variant of the election law was put forward. The newsmen were also informed, that Parliamentary commissions will examine all coming proposals till June 10. By June 15 all proposals will be generalized and submitted for discussion in Milli Mejlis.--0-- ISA GAMBAR SUGGESTS THAT AZERI-RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT COMMISSION FOR CLARIFYING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIMINAL CASE BE CREATED BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: The Chairman of the Milly Mejlis of the Azerbaijan republic, Isa Gambar, sent the return letter to the Chairman of the Russian Supreme Soviet Ruslan Khasbulatov in connection with the conviction of the Russian servicemen lieutenant V.Semion, sergeant K. Tukish, M.Lisov and A.Filipov by the military college of the Supreme Court of Azerbaijan. In his letter, Isa Gambar suggested that the commission of Azerbaijan Milly Mejlis deputates on a par with the experts of the Russian Supreme Soviet be established to clarify the circumstances of this criminal case. In his view, "the conclusion of the commission could help in the objective solving of this problem, as well as such kind of problems in the future. But the main thing is, it could help to promote the knowledge about involvement of the Russian servicemen in crime". In its turn, in connection with the Russian parliament message, Milly Mejlis adopted a resolution on May 19, according to which the permanent commissions on government building and legal policy, human rights and international relations are charged with the exploration of this problem.--0-- WILL THE TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BE RUINED? Baku (May 22) Turan: As Turan agency was informed, Russian representative to the talks on Karabakh, Vladimir Kazimirov, doubted in realization of the Trilateral initiative. He expressed this opinion during a telephone talk with the representatives of Azerbaijan. At the same talk he declared, that in case the peace process deadlocked, Russia would pursue Yeltsin's initiative itself. Such statement from the Russian diplomat, who is one of the authors of the Trilateral initiative, suggests that the Russian leadership is paving the way for complete exclusion of the USA and probably Turkey from the peacemaking process. This statement can also mean, that Russia and US having achieved understanding on Bosnian problem, have agreed on partial US departure from Transcaucasia.--0-- FATE OF 645 MILLION TONS OF OIL WILL BE DECIDED THIS SUMMER Baku (May 22) Turan: The president of Azerbaijan State Oil Company, Sabit Bagirov, declared recently that complete treaty on development of oil fields Chirag, Azeri and Guneshli would be signed this summer. As it is known, western oil companies AMOCO, BP-STATOIL, PENNZOIL- RAMCO have an interest on development of these three richest Caspian fields. According to the plan, SOCAR and BP-STATOIL are to sign a complete treaty on development of Chirag field on June 16. Later AMOCO and PENNZOIL will sign treaties. Specialists value total reserves of these three fields to be 645 million ton. 310 million of them fall on Azeri field, 180 mln.ton on Geneshli and 150 mln.ton on Chirag. The exploitation of these fields is to last tens of years and it is to bring in Azerbaijan 100 billion dollars in revenue. In addition to the net economic profit, Baku calculates upon the political support of the West in the defence of its interests at the international scene. As president Elchibey said in his closest encirclement "the May of 1993 will be one of the most difficult periods for Azerbaijan and its independence and we have to stand these tests".--0-- THE SCIENTIST-LAWYERS OF RUSSIA APPEALED TO THE PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: As the press-service of the president of Azerbaijan informs, today, the appeal of the Institute of the Government and law of the Russian Academy of Sciences to president Elchibey was received. The appeal contains the call "to display mercy, humanism and clemency on the death sentences of the former servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces". The authors of the appeal point out, that they don't justify the participation of the Russian servicemen in the war against the azeri people, don't call in question the lawfulness of the passed sentence, denounce the mercenary according to the UN principals, and they are sorry about the Russian servicemen being drawn in such grave crime. At the end of their letter, scientists, mentioning the soldiers' mothers' tears and grief, their praying day and night of safety, ask the president of Azerbaijan to "save those guys". It should be noticed, that unlike lawyers, soldiers' mothers, taking part in the inquiry, called the cause of their grief only Russian policy. According to their words, the leaders, that lay down lives of Russian men to achieve their political aims, must be made answerable. Unfortunately, the appeal didn't mention the grief of the mothers of Azerbaijani soldiers, killed by sentenced Russian servicemen.--0-- ARMENIAN ARTILLERY CONTINUES FIRING ON AZERI DISTRICTS BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: On May 22, two soldiers of National army of Azerbaijan were killed during the "Grad" shelling of the villages of Kolly Gyshlag, Shaifly, Shotaraz, Nyachaflar of Zangelan district of the republic from the territory of Kafan district of Armenia. The night before and in the morning of May 22, the villages of Tovuz, Gazakh and Gubatly districts of Azerbaijan were under fire from the territory of Armenia. There are destructions. The situation in Agder district of Azerbaijan became complicated. On May 21, the enemy fired on the regional centre of Agdere from the village of Ortakend. The transportation of man power and military equipment to this district is in progress. According to reports the enemy is setting up a new weapon emplacement to fire on the regional centre and near by villages. According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the concentration of man power and military equipment is observed in Krasnoselsky district of Armenia which borders on Azerbaijan as well as on the frontier with Fizuli district. --O-- AZERI PRIME-MINISTER IS LEAVING FOR GREAT BRITAIN BAKU ( MAY 22 ) TURAN : The Minister of Foreign Economic Relations, Rauf Garayev, in his interview to Turan agency said, that "Great Britain is the biggest foreign economic partner of Azerbaijan after Iran". The business cooperation between the two countries develops in such spheres as oil - industry, the manufacture of oil extraction equipment, communication and agriculture. According to the Minister's words, the forthcoming visit of Azerbaijani Prime-Minister, Panah Huseynov, to Great Britain on May 23-24, is very important. It is expected, that the visit will help, to solve the problems of opening in Azerbaijan the branch offices of some British banks, insurance firms; to conclude contracts on the sphere of manufacture of agricultural equipment; on building in Azerbaijan off shore oil platforms, and reconstruction of the entire communication system of Azerbaijan. In Garayev's view, the expansion of the cooperation with Great Britain will have a great political meaning for Azerbaijan. According to politicians and reviewers in Baku, at present, Great Britain as an European state is close to Azerbaijan. The continuation of the economic and political cooperation of the two states is foreseen. --O-- \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ T U R A N N E W S A G E N C Y Baku - Azerbaijan Phone: (8922) 66-7977 66-7833 Fax: (8922) 66-2009 Telex: 142168 META SU \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

In any case, past actions do not And the best evidence you can find is second hand hearsay from an unnamed source? You may indeed be confusing *some* Muslims with Nazi Armenians. Altogether 30,000 Nazi Armenians served in various units in the German Wehrmacht, according to Ara J. Berkian. 14,000 in predominantly Armenian army units, 6,000 in German army units, 8,000 in various working units and 2,000 in the Waffen-SS.[1] A number of these Nazi Armenians were volunteers from France, Greece, Rumania and Bulgaria who had chosen to commit themselves to the German war effort. Derounian says that "Dashnag Armenians from France bore the mark 'Legion Armenienne.'"[2] That Nazi Armenians like Dro 'the Butcher' and Nezhdeh sided with the Germans probably had an impact on the decision of Armenians who overwhelmingly opted for armed service.

[2] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), in 'The Armenian Displaced Persons,' ibid., p. 19. In fall 1942, the Armenian infantry battalions 808 and 809 were formed, to be followed by battalions 810, 812 and 813 in spring 1943. In the second half of 1943 infantry battalions 814, 815 and 816 were created. These battalions together with other indigenous Caucasian units were attached to the infantry division 162. Also attached to ID 162 were the field battalions II/9, I/125 and I/198 which were formed between May 1942 and May 1943. Altogether twelve Armenian battalions served the Nazi army, if battalion II/73, which was not employed at any time, is to be included.[1] Most battalions were commanded by Nazi Armenian officers. Armenians wore German uniforms with an armband in the Dashnag colours red-blue-orange and the inscription 'Armenien.'

While having collaborated with the Nazis against Stalin during the Second World War, Nazi Armenians changed their policy after Hitler's defeat. They now backed Stalin's claims on Eastern Turkish provinces, hoping that these would be annexed to Soviet Armenia and their Muslim population would be exterminated. Stalin played on Armenian national sentiments to enlist the support of Armenians in the USSR and America for his imperial ambitions.[1] Stalin's ultimatum to the Turkish government led Truman to formulate his famous Doctrine.

Lines: 27 Nntp-Posting-Host: watnxt04.ucr.edu Well everybody, After reading tons of notes by Serdar, I have come to the following conclusion. Turkey is PERFECT, and no Turk has ever made a mistake. He has proved to me at least that the land occupied by Turkey today, was ALWAYS lived in peacefully by Turks. (Including Istanbul AKA Constantinople) They treat their minorities like gods and have only done good while all of their evil neighbors attacked them. Somehow, despite these evil neighbors capable of nothing but murder their population has exploded to almost 60 million in Turkey alone. (Note, Armenian worldwide population is approximately 7 million total) I want to go to this heaven on earth and meet the race that has made Serdar possible, that has persevered, and has become a mecca for human rights lovers. (Amnesty International must have bad sources, Turkey would never torture its citizens, treat minorities badly, or kidnap 7 foreign journalists last year alone, who incidentally are still missing), what I am trying to say is I WANT TO BE A TURK!!!! Now back to reality. I have once again been astounded by Serdars ability to ignore all truth, all truly difficult questions, and go on to his encyclopedia of quotes and sources that can be pasted into any note BY THE PAGE! Anybody at all who has believed ANYTHING he has said, please step forward. Let him know he hasn't been wasting his time, that SOMEBODY out there can be convinced by the volume of e-mail you can produce, not the quality of the content. Well I am off now. I will go dream some more about that perfect place, that nirvana, that utopia, that xanadu, that TURKEY! n_w$$h	1

You are somewhat close to truth. But you shouldn't forget that nationality is a recent invention of the western europe. In the days of the Ottoman empire, the religion was the main point of difference between social classes. The Ottomans didn't recognize Turks, Arabs, Greeks, Serbs... Just christians, muslims, jews... So, for all the interested parties in the Ottoman society the bosnian muslims were "Turks". After all, there aren't many "real" (ethnic) Turks living even in Turkey today. Even in Europe, it's the culture that defines the ethnicity and religion is part of one's culture. >Thus, while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of >WWII, and older agenda, the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from >Bosnian, is being carried out under the cover of the Serbo-Croat war.

We had a most peculiar little locomotive, originally built in America for the Russian Government, adapted to burn either wood or oil; one covered truck as men's quarters; one similar, which I fitted up for my- self and a railway officer; and also a truck to carry wood, three cars being the utmost our small engine could pull. With this small outfit we started, rumours of all kinds reaching us before our departure indicating that the whole situation was rapidly coming to a head, it being evident that the Turks were becoming~ more and more restive in the face of the inexplicable delay of the Allies in reaching any definite decision with regard to the future. Travelling on this little "war-time" railway was indeed an experience, and it was necessary to carry a "gauge," and to test the rails with it frequently, for in many places, owing to the sinking of the embankments and the washing away of the ballast, the rails required rectification before we were able to get our train over, even at a foot pace; each bridge also re- quired elaborate examination before adventuring the train upon it, and eventually we were obliged to carry large baulks of tim- ber to temporarily shore up many of the bridges and culverts whilst we passed over them. Under these circumstances it may be imagined that our prog- ress was by no means rapid, and as we had frequently to halt also to replenish our supply of wood fuel, we considered we had achieved wonders when, on the evening of the second day, 60 hours and 70 miles out from Erzeroum, we finally entered the gorge of the mountains where we understood our worst troubles to lie. This is the same gorge into which the road from Erzeroum to Kars descends from the foot-hills to cross the frontier; the railway, however, follows the main Aras River val- ley till the frontier gorge enters it, whilst the road cuts off the corner and joins the rail again at the frontier post of Zivin, some 15 miles from the main valley. Soon after entering the gorge, we were confronted by the first serious fall of rock--about 2,000 tons having fallen from the cliff face and entirely obliterated the railway track.

Shedding Some Light On September 29 1990, the National Council on US-Arab Relations invited the Kuwaiti Ambassador to the United States, Saud Nasser Al-Sabah. The following are quotes of his speech: ``Kuwait itself was an entity identified as Kuwait even before Iraq was identified as Iraq in the Ottoman Empire. Kuwait was in existence since 1752. We continued to be in existence until the conflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British and others in the area. Thereafter, we signed with the British in 1899 a protective agreement whereby the British guaranteed the sovereignty and security of Kuwait.'' ``In 1913, the British and the Ottoman signed an agreement defining without any doubt the borders of Kuwait as they stand today. Such an agreement was reconfirmed in 1932 between the Kuwaiti government and the Iraqi government at that time. That is when Iraq became a state, after Kuwait itself.'' ``In 1961, when we declared our independence Iraq seized the opportunity to claim Kuwait as part of Iraq. There were threats. The British came in, and Arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait. In 1963, Kuwait and Iraq again signed border agreement, thereby defining our territory and Iraq's recognition to the sovereignty and territory of Kuwait.'' ---Compiled by Firyal Alshalalbi Origins of Kuwait The establishment of Kuwait is attributed to Barrak b. Ghurair of the Bani Khalid who used Kuwait as a summer residence. The beginning of Kuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go further up to 1611. Kuwait's name is derived from al-Kut which means fortress. Kuwait is also called Qurain, which is the diminutive of qarn, a horn or hill. Kuwait town flourished and grew since its establishment. The 'Utub, al-Sabah family is a branch of 'Utub, settled in Kuwait during the early 18th century. They lived under the protection of Bani Khalid until 1752. After that, they became independent and Sabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for 'Utub. Carsten Niebuhr (1733-1815) a Dutch explorer was among the first who wrote about the Arabia. He was the mathematician in the scientific expedition sent in 1760 by the King of Denmark to Arabia. He documented details of Arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the Gulf and in the case of Kuwait, he was the first writer to give the two names by which the town was known, Kuwait and Qurain. Niebuhr's chart of the Persian Gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that century, see the map from Abu Hakima, History of Eastern Arabia 1750-1800. pub.1965. Al-Sabah ('Utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern Arabia. According to Ahmed Abu Hakima's conclusions in his well documented study about the history of eastern Arabia between 1750-1800, there was no Ottoman rule on the region. ``In the second half of the 18th century, there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia. In fact, Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged. Their attempts to restore their lost position in al-Hasa through the campaign of Thuwayni in 1786, and Ali Pasha's expedition against the Wahhabis in 1798, were unsuccessful. At Kuwait, the nearest point of the Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra, the Shaikh was under no form of Ottoman control. The aim of 'Utbi external policy was to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the Gulf.'' (p. 182-183) Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that ``Kuwait was not a dependency of Basra, the Persian occupation of Basra (1775-79) did not affect Kuwait.'' (p.183) Kuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab world. This identity was clear to the British and the French who tried to win the support of Kuwait's Sheikh between 1793-95 when the British wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the Gulf area. --- Independent Kuwait This is the first of a series of articles that testify to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans. The following text is related to an expedition carried out by the Ottomans in 1871 against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia (where the oil fields in Saudi Arabia now). Kuwait and its ruler at that time, Sheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir, allied themselves with the Turks:} Abdullah' role in the fighting was not a minor one. He joined the expedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first to use its guns against the besieged town of Al-Qatif. Had it not been for this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet, Al-Qatif obviously would not have surrendered in a mere three hours. In relation to this, a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships refrained from participating in the bombardment. The answer lies in reports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of the progress of the expedition. Because the Ottomans were unwilling to jeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area, the Sultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the war against Su'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone. Kuwait, which was not a party to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861, was under no such obligation especially since the expedition was not directed against those who had signed it. [ From the above text, we can see that Kuwait was not part of the Ottomans or the British colonies. For more details about the mentioned expedition, please check out the source of the above text: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill University, Canada ] --- Independent Kuwait--2 This is another article of a series of articles that testify to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans. The following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair, Iraq, between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Al-Zuhair tribe in Zubair. In 1866, trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the estate which was [purchased] by his father, Sheikh Jabir, in 1836. This property was sequestered by a Turkish Qa'immaqam [representative] on the basis of a claim by the Al-Zuhair that the vendor had been the owner of a share and not of the n 100e Sufiyya. At the same time, Sheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at the island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian territory. It should be recalled that the Turkish officials from the start showed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants. Abdulla Ibn Sabah, the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his father's agent in the case, narrowly escaped being thrown into jail upon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven years produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were entitled to receive. Eventually, the dispute was settled by the Wali [Governor] of Baghdad in favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait. The decision of the Governor of Basra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons. Some writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the Turkish side, and suggest that the Governor, Namiq Pasha, even offered him the title of Qa'immaqam, which he declined. Nevertheless, the proceedings of the Turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants of Kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with Zubair. It seems that they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the British Agent at Basra, the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to abandon their town rather than submit to Turkish rule. Lorimer suggests that the final order of Namiq Pasha, upholding the Kuwait Sheikh's title to Sufiyya, was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah, ``with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go against him, had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support from the Wahhabi Amir.'' In addition to this legal matter with Zubair, Kuwait had had other problems with Basra whose courts tried to jail Abdulla Ibn Sabah, as explained above. However, Kuwait's relations with the Ottoman mutasallims of Basra had at times been amicable and in several instances, those mutasallims even sought refuge at Kuwait when pressured by the Pashas of Baghdad who exercised control over them. [ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill University, Canada ] --- Independent Kuwait--3 This is another article that testifies to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans. When Pelly [Colonel Pelly, the British Resident in the Gulf] visited Kuwait for the first time on March 3, 1863, he was met at Jahra by Sheikh Mubarak, the second son of the ruler, Sheikh Sabah. Just before he reached Kuwait town on March 4, he was met by Sheikh Abdulla, the eldest son and heir apparent, who accompanied him to the town gate on their way to ``a very good home,'' which had been prepared for Pelly and his companions. ``Scarcely had we entered it,'' says Pelly, ``when Sheikh Sabah himself came.'' This description of Pelly's reception indicates that to a certain degree it was run according to protocol. The government system of Kuwait and administration of justice were the subject of comments made by Pelly. ``The Government is patriarchal,'' says Pelly, ``the Sheikh managing the political, and the Cazee [Qadi] the judicial departments. The Sheikh himself would submit to the Cazee's decision.'' Punishment was rarely inflicted. ``Indeed, there seems little government interference anywhere, and little need of an army.'' Pelly in admiration of how the Sheikh ran the affairs of the country, retold the following remark which the Sheikh had made to him: When my father was nearly 120 years old, he called me and said, ``I shall soon die. I have made no fortune, and can leave you no money, but I have made many and true friends, grapple them. While other states around the Gulf have fallen off from injustice or ill-government, mine has gone on [flourishing]. Hold to my policy, and though you are surrounded by desert, and pressed by a once hostile and still wandering set of tribes, you will prosper.'' [ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill University, Canada ] --- Independent Kuwait--4 This is another article that testifies to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans. The British had always regarded Sheikh Jabir as a ``good friend,'' but in October 1839, an event took place at Kuwait which could have weakened those good relations. On October 30, Lieutenant Edmunds, the Assistant Resident at Abu Shahr [in Iran], arrived in Kuwait on a special mission from the Resident, Captain Hennell. His mission was to find out if Kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a British line of post across the desert from Kuwait to the Mediterranean. The British war vessel fired the usual salute in honor of the Sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of Kuwait Bay. The salute was not acknowledged and Edmunds waited in the vessel for three days before he was able to communicate with the Sheikh. After Edmunds' return to Abu Shahr, both he and Captain Hennell explained this unusual behavior of the Sheikh, to have been due not to ill-will, but principally to a desire to mislead the Egyptian agent at Kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the British. Therefore, they considered that Jabir's conduct did not indicate any change in his friendly policies towards the British. If the British tolerated the attitude of Jabir towards Edmunds, so also did the Egyptians. Earlier in the same year, some of the most wanted men in the Wahhabi camp, such as 'Umar Ibn 'Ufaisan, the Wahhabi general in Al-Hasa, and Wahhabi tribes like Al-Duwaish, sought refuge in Kuwait. Protection of refugees seeking political asylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by Sheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah. This can, therefore, be looked upon as an indication of self-confidence; an outcome of Kuwait's independence from foreign powers. It corroborates the fact that Kuwait, if necessary, was prepared to defend itself against more powerful neighbors. This defense depended not only on the walls of the city, but also on bedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with the necessary guns comparable to other Arab fleets of the time. As to Kuwait's position between 1815 and 1839, one can safely state that it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the struggling Wahhabis and Egyptians. Relations with the British and even with the Pasha of Baghdad continued on good terms. [ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill University, Canada ] --- They were trying to recover land they believed was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.

According to the report, Israel is expected to offer the Palestinians new proposals regarding the authority of the Palestinian Executive Council, general elections, control over land and human rights issues in the Territories. Israel will express its readiness to give the Palestinians control of more land than previously offered. According to the radio report, one estimate is that Israel will give the Palestinians control over as much as two thirds of the administered lands, as well as broad authority on water issues. Israel will seek to promote its offer to hold elections in the Territories in hopes of strengthening the position of the Palestinian delegation to the peace negotiations. According to Israel Radio, the Israeli delegation to the bilateral talks with the Palestinians will offer greater responsibilities to the Palestinian Executive Council allowing it certain legislative capabilities, without making it a symbol for Palestinian sovereignty.

My point is that it will inevitably turn out that way, and we can save ourselves a lot of pain and trouble by simply letting people sort out their problems on their own. Colonial interventions, even in Haiti, haven't worked in the past. They had a 102 coups from 1845-1915. The US invaded in 1915. And left in 1933, almost 17 years after they had intended to. Was it a success? Well, look at Haiti today and of the past 40 years and decide for yourself. It _was_ a success so long as the US was in, from what I remember.

It is [EE] also known that some Armenian communities were converted into Catholicism [EE] and Protestantism by the Western European missionaries in this period. The vast majority of Armenians in eastern Anatolia were Gregorian or Armenian Apostolic.

This is not true. While it was forbidden for Armenians to speak Armenian in certain areas of Cilician Armenia, most all Armenians spoke Armenian. In fact, Turks who interacted with Armenians also spoke Armenian! For sure, most all Armenians, especially men, also knew Turkish in order to function in larger society. [EE] My question is, given so many separations in the Armenian community, what [EE] was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian [EE] nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century? As I stated, religion [EE] was not uniform (unlike the Greeks) and many Armenians couldn't even speak [EE] Armenian. I would like to know what factors brought the Armenians in the [EE] Ottoman Empire together and led to the formation of an Armenian [EE] consciousness. The Armenians in Turkey were persecuted because they were Armenian, regardless of the specific branch of Christianity they professed. The resultant Armenian nationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution. Even at the later stages of WWI, and after the genocide, many Armenians who were converted to Islam were also exterminated because they continued as Armenian Moslems. This practice continued well into the 1920s by Ataturk in parallel with the policy of clearing out pockets of steadfast Islamic fundamentalism. Many of these converted Armenians, ironically, in order to stay alive, were staunch Moslems. [EE] Any information will be appreciated. You answered your own question!

As an example: (1) murder is morally incorrect (2) the idea that one group of people is somehow racially inferior to another is morally incorrect etc. The point is that any action which serves to promote a morally incorrect action should be forbidden. This implies that no one has the right to say that an innocent person should be murdered. Regardless of freedom of speech, I may not stand on a street corner and advocate the murder of innocent people. The reason for this is that murder is a morally incorrect action. In the same way, since bigotry is morally incorrect in the narrow definition which we have given it, (2), I, nor any one else, has the right to stand on a street corner and promote bigotry. Such an enforcement does in no way deny any one their rights as guaranteed by the first amendment. It merely ensures that no person may be the target of an attempt to deny him a fundamental moral right, such as the right to not be murdered, and the right not to be discriminated against. I believe, Mr. Berson, that to blindly accept the constitution is a terrific mistake. We must cinstantly question the constitution and interpret it in a way befitting the society in which we live. Anything short of such an effort would render us little more than trained monkeys, who are able to merely repeat what they have heard without paying the slightest bit of attention to the intent of the document in question. Would you disagree, Mr.Berson? Harry.	1

The biased presentation of facts, as well as the conclusions that you reach leave me little hope of engaging in any fruitful exchange that might lead to a "meeting of the minds". It is to those who read with open mind, that I address myself. %The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of %Racial Discrimination adopted by the General Assembly of the %United Nations in 1965, has now been ratified by most member %states. Article 1 of this Convention defines the term racial %discrimination as "any distinction, exclusion, restriction or %preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic %origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing %the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of %human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, %social, cultural or any other field of public life." While the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals, as the text currently stands I know of no country in which racial discrimination of some sort can not be found. It makes no mention of the need for for a legislative violation. %The General Assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining %Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. The %important, correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since %it does not include operative statements designed to end Israeli %racial discrimination. Meanwhile the United States, on behalf of %Israel, are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the United %Nations to repeal this resolution and give Israeli racial %practices - Zionism - moral legitimacy. If you are, in principle, advocating UN intervention via operative statements in this case, it must therefore hold that they can be applied to any other case where the council perceives some form of racial discrimination as previously exhibited. Scarey thought. %The very definition of Israel as a State belonging to the Jews of %the world (but not to its inhabitants), alienates all native %non-Jews born in that country. Actually, I know quite a few native non-Jews born in Israel that are not alienated by this law. If you had said some, you would probably be correct, however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes apparent. This slant permeates the text. %Practically all non-Jews who are living in or originate from areas %under Israeli control, identify themselves as Palestinians. Most %of them are Muslim, many are Christian. A few Jews, including the %author of these lines, also identify themselves as Palestinians. The above statement is not true. Practically all - discounting Beduins, Circassians, Druze, and some other fringe groups. Your own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the issue. You could equally identify yourself as a [insert group]. %Zionism took off in Europe at the end of last century. It's aim %was to create a Jewish state in Palestine in spite of the adamant %opposition of Palestinian Arabs (95% of the population). If I recall correctly, at the time "zionism" took off, there was no adamant opposition in Palestine. I am open to any factual contradictory evidence . %But the %Zionists were more powerful, militarily, economically and %technologically, and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the %area of Mandatory Palestine. After driving into exile most native %Arabs from the conquered areas, approximately 750,000 people, and %razing most of their villages to the ground, the Zionists could %finally establish a predominantly Jewish State. Only 150,000 %non-Jews remained on Israeli territory. Do you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on "most of their villages"? %Once the Jewish State was established, it began enacting laws to %help the confiscation of land from native non-Jews, their %political repression and their destitution. There is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later used for these purposes. However, you seem to imply that this was the intention a priori, which implies a policy and agenda. My knowledge was that this was not the case. You also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded this. As you do again, below. %In 1967 the State of Israel invaded Egypt and Syria and occupied %the rest of Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza strip). Thus %another 1.5 million Palestinians fell under its juridiction. Its %occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories is considered %illegal by the international community, as reflected in Security %Council resolutions. Israel has rejected all U.N. resolutions and %began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these %territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time. Not quite accurate. Israel has not rejected all the resolutions, though it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them. Israel never annexed the Sinai, West Bank, or Gaza. The other annexations were brought about partly due to the UN resolutions. %Part of these territores, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, %have already been forcefully annexed by Israel, in defiance of %international law and UN resolutions. Out of curiousity, provided that the annexees are granted citizenship, what int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories captured in war? Has this ever been applied to any other country previously (other than Iraq) ? %It must be emphasized that, although these people live under %different regimes, they are united in their self-perception as %Palestinians, that is as people identifying with Palestine, a %territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity). Incorrect! Palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against on an "ethnic or racial" basis. Therefore your above statement is incorrect. I also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination, the only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically. However, no such nation has existed. It definitely did not exist at the time of the creation of Israel, in which case you can not argue racial discrimination during that period! %Furthermore Palestinians generally consider the PLO both as a %symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that %represents them in world affairs. Once again, some do, some don't. %The non-Jewish population living in the Palestinian and other Arab %territories occupied by Israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant %discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation. Another generalization, but then again, you don't seem to care about anyone other than the Palestinian people, whose cause you espouse. %licence, to start a business and to buy industrial equipment, the %right to educate children, all of these basic rights are subject %to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be %challenged in court. Incorrect once again. They have the ability to appeal. Furthermore, although you may not agree with them, not all of the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary. Some are, but this is not due to the "whims" of the military as much as the sizeof the task/organization. %Only Jewish inhabitants of the occupied %territories are permitted to carry firearms. Incorrect once again. I know two Arab policemen who lived in Daheisha and there were more. Of course, with the outbreak of the intifada they were forced by the locals to resign, bitterly. %Jewish settlers have %right to 6-7 more water per person than non-Jews. Jewish residents %of these territories number now about 100,000 people. It is Israel %governmentUs policy to increase this number substantially, in %total defiance of international law, UN resolutions and the will %of the population. The State of Israel systematically confiscates %land from non-Jewish inhabitants of these territories for Jewish %settlement. That is no longer true, and I can't help but wonder what your purpose is/was in posting this. %Some 800,000 people in Israel proper,are not Jews. Most of them %consider themselves Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. For %many years after the establishment of Israel they were subjected %to harsh military control. Much of their land was confiscated by %the State and handed to Jewish organisations for exclusive Jewish %settlement. They have been subject to massacres, destitution and %humiliation. While they enjoy, with Jewish Israelis, the right to %vote, they are discriminated against both through law and in %practice. Once again, to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in, right? Their are many villages who did not suffer in the way you seem to indicate, Abu Gosh comes to mind. Yes, some did but as a result of what actions? %Approximately 92% of the surface of the State of Israel within the %Rgreen lineS is for all purposes closed to Palestinians who are %second-class citizens in Israel. They may neither legally live on %such land, nor rent or cultivate it. A direct effect of these %policies is that native non-Jewish citizens of Israel are denied %residence and membership rights in most rural communities in %Israel, including the collective settlements, kibbutzim. Non-Jews %are discriminated against in many other ways: The Government %starves local authorities of Palestinian villages and townships of %funds; Jewish city councils force Palestinians to live in ghettos; %Jewish families receive higher child allocations than their %non-Jewish neighbors, Palestinian schools suffer underfunding and %understaffing (as compared to Jewish schools); Palestinian %children are denied the right to learn their history and %literature; Israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end %of racial discrimination, suffer continuous harassment by the %authorities. 1. There are some kibbutzim with Arab/Non-Jewish members. It is up to the members of the kibbutz. There is no legislation against it, nor against a purely non-Jewish collective. 2. Funds are the result of political lobbying. Bearing in mind that non_Jews compose ~20% of the voting population, it has never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large bloc, and increase their power. The recent elections are a case in point. 3. Please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation with regard to educational material. You have obviously never seen the curriculum of a school in the West Bank. It is based upon Jordan's school system. 4. With regard to your last statement, it is simply another gross generalization. %The State of Israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the State of %all its inhabitants. Although the Israeli Cabinet has never %openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea (the forced removal from the %country of its native Palestinian population, that is, its %ultimate Judaization), Israeli government policies towards %non-Jews bear the mark of this 'Final Solution'. No attempt is %made by the Zionist authorities to integrate Palestinian Arabs %into Israeli public life. Thus, although comprising approximately %17% of the population of Israeli citizens, no Palestinian citizen %of Israel has ever served as Cabinet member, as director of %ministry or of a national institution, as judge of the Supreme %Court, as ambassador of Israel, or in any leading position in %Israeli economic or financial life. Even the director of the %Ministry for Arab Affairs - yes, such a thing exists! - is a Jew. Another generalization, but lets not stop here. The transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't, Moledet. It was intended to be a solution to the problem in the territories, not the country itself. With regard to other items, I recall at least one Arab ambassador, and the rest was covered previously. %Although sexual %relations between and cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews are legal, %they are considered by Israeli/Zionist society somewhat a betrayal %of the Jewish and Zionist ethics. The Israeli educational system %nurtures this attitude in a systematic way. When was the last time you were in Israel? That is simply not true, nor has it been for quite some time. The question of religious intervention is best answered by the proportional representation and the lack of any Arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one. %Zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state, based on %equality of all citizens. This is one main reason why Israel has %not produced any written Constitution. Simply incorrect. The answer is political. Once again, your failure to understand the dynamics and movements inside Israeli gov't, relegates your contentions to the sidelines. %Zionism predicates a state %where Jews have privileged rights. Thus, according to Israeli law, %a Jew born in London, who has never visited Israel, does not speak %Hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic Israeli %citizenship, while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be %Christian or Muslim, are treated almost as aliens. Racial %discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only %reflected in Israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the %very nature of Israel as a Jewish state. But the discrimination is not based upon race. Oops, sorry, nasty habit I have of countering malicious false truths. %Any proposal for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace that %does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel - %that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel - is thus doomed %to fail. Real world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail. Of course, I wouldn't expect you to understand, wrapped up as you are in your VIEW of things.

I have no idea what this guy means but the Syrian Jews are not allowed to leave Syria because Assad welshed on his promise and is not letting them go. Israel has nothing to do with it. As for the other Arab countries there are still small communities left in some Arab countries. Morocco has the largest group I think comprising perhaps just over a thousand (but I have lost the exact figure. Maybe someone will be so kind as to post it). There are communities left in Yemen (which went to the polls yesterday in what might appear to be a free-ish election), Algeria (this is a tiny group, a couple of leftist intellectuals I think), of course Syria and Lebannon. The circumstances of the departure of the Jews from various Arab countries is controversial in some cases - like Iraq - and I do not want to get into a dispute about it. Egypt expelled most of its community outright. Most of the French North African Jews left rather than face Independence. I think that Moroccans might have been encouraged by some AntiSemitic acts but I am not sure. Someone else around here will know for sure. There are claims that Israeli intellegence officers spread rumours around Algeria that the Jews would not be welcome but this is probably just propaganda. It would take a very stupid person not to realise the benefits of a move to France (as most did) or to Israel. Yemeni Jews were airlifted to Israel.

You don't get it - do you? During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways: 1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility. 2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide. 3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests. 4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian. Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue. Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide. With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial demands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims of the Turkish Genocide demand: 1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide; 2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people; 3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide; 4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian political pressure; 5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands; 6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.

Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897, however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia."

The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and outside the law. When they became a legally instituted, recognized governing body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands, they proved incompetent to do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days. The outstanding feature of their rule, now that they were in power, was, as in the old days, trial and execution without hearing. A man evoking the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. The method of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back of his head and blow out his brains. This simple way of getting rid of those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became a common way of paying debts." p. 203 (first paragraph). "A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar. I saw the point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...Another soldier seized a rock and pounded the Tartar's head with it... The Armenian who had bayoneted him sprang to his feet, wrested the weapon from the Tartar's body, and, raising it to his lips, licked it clean of blood, exclaiming in Russian, 'Slodkey! Slodkey!' (Sweet.)" p. 203 (second paragraph). "One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village. Among the ruins a fire was burning. I went to the fire and saw seated about it a group of soldiers. Among them were two Tartar girls, mere children. The girls were crouched on the ground, crying softly with suppressed sobs. Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes. There were also bodies of the dead." p. 204 (first paragraph). "I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying, I entered the yard of a house, which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a year old." p. 118. "Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging them with shrill Tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the carts, the women, veiled as is the Tartar way, held children in their arms. Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot. Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety. This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene.... That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted and completely destroyed." p. 192. "Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced.... They entered into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores that had been left by the Turks." p. 193. "Terrible vengeance was taken upon Tartars, Kurds and Turks. Their villages were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country." p. 195. "The fanatical Dashnacks hated the Turks above all others and then in order of diminishing intensity: Tartars, Kurds and Russians." p. 218. (First and second paragraphs) "Russian troops did terrible things in the Turkish villages...We Armenians did not spare the Tartars....If persisted in, the slaughtering of prisoners, the looting, and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace actions expected and accepted as a matter of course. I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground, in numbers, like the fallen leaves in a forest. They had been as helpless and as defenseless as sheep. They had not died as soldiers die in the heat of battle, fired with ardor and courage, with weapons in their hands, and exchanging blow for blow. They had died as the helpless must, with their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself." p. 133 (first paragraph) "In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians abandoned the struggle. During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the brutality displayed, but could not make any effective protest. Some, mercifully, were shot. Many of them were burned to death. The method employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut, and then after crowding the hut with Turks, set fire to the straw." p. 19 (first paragraph) "The Tartar section of the town no longer existed, except as a pile of ruins. It had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered. The same fate befell the Tartar section of Khankandi." p. 22 (second paragraph) "Many of our men had served in the Russian Army, and were trained soldiers. We Armenians were rich and possessed arms. Tartars had never received military training. They were poor, and possessed few arms beyond knives. ...Shortly after the killing of the Tartars in our village, the revolution in Russia was suppressed." p. 97 (third paragraph) "Within a few years, following the beginning of the movement, an invisible government of Armenians by Armenians had been established in Turkish Armenia in armed opposition to the Turkish Government. This secret government had its own courts and laws and an army of assassins called 'Mauserists' (professional killers) to enforce its decrees." p. 98 (first paragraph) "The Dashnacks were in continual open rebellion against the Turkish Government." p. 98 (third paragraph) "...the Dashnacks engineered a general revolt of Armenians in Turkish Armenia under the mistaken belief that European nations would intervene and secure independence for Turkish Armenia." p. 99 (second paragraph) "The Dashnacks were fanatics." p. 99 (third paragraph) "The Dashnacks took advantage of this situation and extended their revolutionary activities into the Russian province. They instituted a campaign of terrorism and employed threats and force in securing contributions to the party funds from rich Armenians. A wealthy man would be assessed a stipulated sum. Refusal to pay brought upon him a sentence of death. Every member of the party was pledged to carry out orders without question. If a man were to be assassinated, lots might be drawn to select an executioner or the job might be assigned to one of the 'mauserists' of the party." p. 130 (first paragraph) "...in moments of victory against Turks and Kurds or Tartars, they [Armenians] have been remorseless in seeking vengeance." p. 130 (third paragraph) "The city was a scene of confusion and terror. During the early days of the war, when the Russian troops invaded Turkey, large numbers of the Turkish population abandoned their homes and fled before the Russian advance." p. 159 (second paragraph) "I made a cannon, a huge gun to lift which required four men. I made balls for it. With my cannon the Armenians could knock down any of the Tartar houses and so they were able to drive the Tartars out." p. 181 (first paragraph) "The Tartar villages were in ruins." p. 189 (third paragraph) "The dead Tartar lay with his head in a pool of mud and blood, his beard still setaceous and now crimsoned."

Just christians, muslims, jews... Pardon me? Your ignorance cramps my conversation. Although the administrative mechanism was a strictly centralized one, the Ottoman Empire 'was a classical example of a pluralist social order.' The 'millet system' was the mechanism which shaped the social order of the multi-national Ottoman Empire and stood behind its continuity. As a matter of fact, because Islamic principles were in force in the Ottoman Empire, it was natural to use religious criteria to differentiate among the various communities which constituted the Empire. The 'millet' system began to be based on ethnicity in the 19th century under the influence of nationalism. Sousa writes of the existence of thirteen communities in the Ottoman Empire in addition to the Muslim 'millet' in 1914. These were: (1) Greeks attached to the Orthodox Patriarchate in Istanbul; (2) Catholics or Latins who were remnants of Genoese and Venetian merchants; (3) Gregorian Armenians attached to a Patriarchate in Istanbul; (4) Catholic Armenians; (5) Syrian Catholics attached to a Patriarchate in Mardin; (6) Chaldean Catholics attached to a Patriarchate in Mosul; (7) Syrian Jacobites attached to a Patriarchate in Mardin; (8) Protestants; (9) Melchites attached to a Patriarchate in Damascus; (10) Hebrews of two rites; (11) Bulgarian Catholics attached to the Bulgarian Exarch; (12) Maronites; and (13) Nestorians.[1] Scholars who studied the pluralistic social structure outlined briefly above, concluded that the social order of the Ottoman Empire fit the framework of the 'Mosaics Theory.'[2] [1] N.

"In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population, closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during the next two days." "Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions, Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims. Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common soldiers began deserting in droves." "With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks, Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading Russian armies." "...Meanwhile, Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans, with the president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response: 'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the glorious Russian Army, with their blood to serve the victory of Russian arms...Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the Bosporus. Let, with Your will, great Majesty, the peoples remaining under the Turkish yoke receive freedom. Let the Armenian people of Turkey who have suffered for the faith of Christ receive resurrection for a new free life under the protection of Russia.'[155] Armenians again flooded into the czarist armies.

I went through this just a few weeks ago; here it comes again. The entire Turkish population of Armenia (which Armenians called Tartars) constituted at least about 40% of the total population of Armenia was deliberately exterminated. (For the population statistics, please look to the book of Richard Hovannessian, "Armenia on the Road to Independence.") I listed three books earlier of such a monstrous crime by the writings of one Armenian, one American, and one British. They are: "Men Are Like That" by Leonard R. Hartill; "Adventures in the Near East" by A. Rawlinson; "World Alive, A Personal Story" by Robert Dunn. Also, I personally have copies of documents of this crime by the writings of two Armenians and also one American. The official British report about this massacre mentioned in one of these documents (Lord Curzon-Aharonin interview) is the report of the British High Commissioner to Caucasia, Sir Oliver Wardrop. "An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. The memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the U.S. in 1926 with the title 'Men Are Like That.' Other references abound."

Also, there are a lot of ideas that have no meaning to me: The idea of a chosen people, the idea of a given right to the land of Israel, the idea of keeping kosher, the idea of opposing intermarriage, the idea of having a Torah that was inspired by god, etc. By being an atheist, I cannot support the idea of the Jewish Nation as defined by a religious principle or based on a religious identity. For me, religion is just another piece in what constitutes the cultural identity of the Jewish people. I believe that as a people with a cultural identity they constitute a Nation and have the same right as any other people in the world to have their own State. The same right as the Armenians have, as the Palestinians have, as the French have, and as anybody else have. I cannot say that by accepting a different god someone has lost all cultural identification. > >Adam > > > >Adam Shostack adam@das.harvard.edu AAP	1

"Muslim" in ex-Yugoslavia was a *nation* not a religion. In fact, not all Muslims in B-H are followers of Islam. Therefore, there do (did?) exist in ex-Yugoslavia "Christian Muslims." Tito defined the Muslim nation constitutionally, adding Muslims to Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, the three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at the end of WWI. In addition, Tito added two other nations constitutionally: Montenegrins, and Makedonijans. Nations had the right of secession, but republics did not. So, "Muslim" is much more a political term than a religious term (for those who differentiate between religion and politics, that is) in B-H. It was not a "Christo-Slavic" ideology that made a Muslim nation in Yugoslavia, it was the "Atheist Communist" ideology of Tito. Before Tito, there was no Muslim nation in Yugoslavia. The war is not a religious war, and it is not an ethnic war. It is a civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns instead of pens. The Croat, Muslim, and Serb political leaders *all* chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements. -Nick	1

They are Pomaks and Gypsies. Oboy, this is exciting. First you discuss your non-existent literature tastes, then your fantasies, and now your choices of historical revisionism. Are you related to 'Arromdians' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle? The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference to 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the existence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger Turkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the three nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized according to the agreements? It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world. The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish minority. They pursue the same denial in connection with the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition, in 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091, virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting religious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek governments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective of the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in Greece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders. Talk about democracy. The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic convention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' Greek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection of historical monuments. The government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward Hellenizing the region. The longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' in titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks in Western Thrace. Such community associations had been active until 1984. But they were first told to remove the word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down. This is also the final verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court. Helsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their findings were published in a report titled 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.' The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the Lausanne Convention. |1| HELSINKI WATCH: "PROBLEMS OF TURKS IN WESTERN THRACE CONTINUE" Ankara (A.A) In a 15-page report of the "Helsinki Watch" it is stated that the Turkish minority in Western Thrace is still faced with problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being implemented by the Greek Government be brought to an end. The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government should grant social and political rights to all the members of minorities that are equal to those enjoyed by Greek citizens and in addition they must recognize the existence of the "Turkish Minority" in Western Thrace and grant them the right to identify themselves as 'Turks'. NEWSPOT, May 1992 |2| GREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS The Xanthi independent MP Ahmet Faikoglu said that the Greek state is trying to cut all contacts and relations of the Turkish minority with Turkey. Pointing out that while the Greek minority living in Istanbul is called "Greek" by ethnic definition, only the religion of the minority in Western Thrace is considered. In an interview with the Greek newspaper "Ethnos" he said: "I am a Greek citizen of Turkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in Western Trace are also Turkish." Emphasizing the education problem for the Turkish minority in Western Thrace Faikoglu said that according to an agreement signed in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey in Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace. Recalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr. SadIk Ahmet to defend the rights of the Turkish minority, Faikoglu said. "In fact we helped Greece. Because we prevented Greece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European countries by forcing the Greek government to recognize our legal rights." On Turco-Greek relations, he pointed out that both countries are predestined to live in peace for geographical and historical reasons and said that Turkey and Greece must resist the foreign powers who are trying to create a rift between them by cooperating, adding that in Turkey he observed that there was will to improve relations with Greece. NEWSPOT, January 1993 |3| MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE. Two ethnic Macedonian human rights activists will face trial in Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS. Hristos Sideropoulos and Tashko Bulev (or Anastasios Bulis) have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in an Athenian magazine. Sideropoulos and Bulev gave an interview to the Greek weekly magazine "ENA" on March 11, 1992, and said that they as Macedonians were denied basic human rights in Greece and would field an ethnic Macedonian candidate for the up-coming Greek general election. Bulev said in the interview: "I am not Greek, I am Macedonian." Sideropoulos said in the article that "Greece should recognise Macedonia. The allegations regarding territorial aspirations against Greece are tales... We are in a panic to secure the border, at a time when the borders and barriers within the EEC are falling." The main charge against the two, according to the court summons, was that "they have spread...intentionally false information which might create unrest and fear among the citizens, and might affect the public security or harm the international interests of the country (Greece)." The Greek state does not recognise the existence of a Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000 ethnic Macedonians living within Greece, largely concentrated in the north. It is a crime against the Greek state if anyone declares themselves Macedonian. In 1913 Greece, Serbia-Yugoslavia and Bulgaria partioned Macedonia into three pieces. In 1919 Albania took 50 Macedonian villages. The part under Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991 as the independent Republic of Macedonia. There are 1.5 million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000 in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper. Sideropoulos has been a long time campaigner for Macedonian human rights in Greece, and lost his job as a forestry worker a few years ago. He was even exiled to an obscure Greek island in the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced the Greek government to allow him to return to his home town of Florina (Lerin) in Northern Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the majority of ethnic Macedonians live. Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos affair as a show trial in which Greece is desperate to clamp down on internal dissent, especially when it comes to the issue of recognition for its northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia. Last year the State Department of the United States condemned Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the US government will do anything until the Presidential elections are over. ================================================================ M. I. L.

Source: "World Alive, A Personal Story" by Robert Dunn. Crown Publishers, Inc., New York (1952). (Memoirs of an American officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people) p. 361 (seventh paragraph) and p. 362 (first paragraph). 'The most are inside houses. Come you and look.' 'No, dammit! My stomach isn't-' 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform. Him you must see.' "We were under those trees by the mosque, in an open space.... 'I don't believe you," I said, but followed to a nail-studded door. The man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse. I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and went inside. The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted, as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his slashed genitals." p. 363 (first paragraph). 'How many people lived there?' 'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned. 'Did you see any Turk officers?' 'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.' "The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me - Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion, Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would have been. From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around..... The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags, looms, even spinning-wheels. 'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains. Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'" p. 354. "At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian, but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on Moslem villages." p. 358. "It will be three hours to take," Dro told me. We'd close in on three sides. "The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets," Merrimanov said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow. "That is for morale," Dro put in. "We must keep the Moslems in terror." "Soldiers or civilians?" I asked. "There is no difference," said Dro. "All are armed, in uniform or not." "But the women and children?" "Will fly with the others as best they may." p. 360. "The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.' Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling; then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though I heard our Utica brass roar. As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed, dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly. The came a shrill wailing. Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot. 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries. At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly, through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb." p. 361 (fourth paragraph). "Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting.

Source: 'International Economics: Theory and Policy' by Paul R. Krugman and Maurice Obstfeld, Harper Collins Publishers, 1991, (second edition). In terms of 'Annual Output Per Person in Dollars Adjusted to Purchasing Power Parity,' Greece is in the same category with Turkiye. Indeed, Greek Governments have enormous problems to tackle. The economy is in shambles, corruption is rampant, air pollution is in outrageous dimensions, state-sponsored terrorism is the name of the game and infrastructure is decaying. Another insightful article in the New York Times (Sunday, April 7) exposes the dirty linen of Greece, and describes her as the pariah of the European Community. The article reports that ''...with un-European antics, Greece uses the Community as a cash register. She squanders, and at times even steals the European tax payers' money for political featherbedding at home. The principal members of the Community admit that it was a mistake to accept Greece to the European Community.'' This affirmation is testimony to the fact that notwithstanding her geographic location, Greece is un-European in mentality and attitude. Indeed, during the last 12 years, Turkiye registered a great success with regard to economic restructuring. A sound economy, ready to be integrated to the world economies, has emerged, succeeding to the faltering one, witnessed in the '70s. Just 12 years ago, Greece used to export double as much as Turkiye did. Now inversely, Turkiye's overall exports exceed by far that of Greece. As far as the tourism incomes are concerned, we are witnessing the same phenomenon. The governments in Turkiye have put a particular emphasis on the infrastructure investments (rather than investing in world terrorist organizations), thereby solving this issue completely. Indeed, in the '70s, it was out of the question to conduct a telephone call from Eastern Anatolia to the West. Nowadays, this is not the case at all, and in a far remote town, even in a village you may have, at any time, a long-distance call to any given country. However, the same could not be applied to Greece. In fact, it is not so easy in Athens to have a trunk call to Germany round the clock. And if you happen to be in the Greek islands, then your chance will be pretty slim. Therefore, it would not be an exaggeration to argue that Turkiye is far ahead of Greece in regard to telecommunication facilities. Greece, by virtue of its full membership, has enjoyed all advantages of the EC, obtaining huge grants and extensive subsidies. Turkiye, having no access at all to similar financial supports, has nevertheless managed to create a better economy which enabled it to produce consecutive current accounts surplus over the last two years. As such, Turkiye deserves to be the only country in its region having permanent current accounts surplus.

Tsiel, I would contend that there was shelling from both sides of the border, starting from the early 70's.

At the very least we can say that both sides exchanged shelling, with occasional aerial raids by Israel on Lebanese villages. In any case Steve's characterization that the 1982 invasion was only in response to years of shelling from Lebanon is false. Israel had many reasons for invading but mainly it did so to install a government in Lebanon favorable to Israel, and it nearly achieved this aim with the election of Basheer El Gemayel, and his brother, Amin El Gemayel, but the internal situation in Lebanon was too hard to control and predict so Israel had to withdraw, and Amin El Gemayel had to abrogate the 17 th of May Agreement. |> |> Tsiel |> -- |> ----8<--------------------------------------------------------------->8------ |> Tsiel:ohayon@jcpl.co.jp | If you do not receive this E-mail, please let me |> Employer may not have same | know as soon as possible, if possible. |> opinions, if any ! | Two percent of zero is almost nothing.

The report compiled by the U.S. embassy in Khartoum said government forces, particularly Arab militias organized as the Popular Defense Forces, "routinely steal women and children" in southern Sudan. "Some women and girls are kept as wives, the others are shipped north where they perform forces labor on Kordofan (central Sudan) farms or are exproted, notably to Libya," it said.	1

They were attacking the Iraqis to drive them out of Kuwait, a country whose citizens have close blood and business ties to Saudi citizens. And me thinks if the US had not helped out the Iraqis would have swallowed Saudi Arabia, too (or at least the eastern oilfields). And no Muslim country was doing much of anything to help liberate Kuwait and protect Saudi Arabia; indeed, in some masses of citizens were demonstrating in favor of that butcher Saddam (who killed lotsa Muslims), just because he was killing, raping, and looting relatively rich Muslims and also thumbing his nose at the West.

You make it sound like these guys are angels, Ilyess. (In your clarinet posting you edited out some stuff; was it the following???) Friday's New York Times reported that this group definitely is more conservative than even Sheikh Baz and his followers (who think that the House of Saud does not rule the country conservatively enough). The NYT reported that, besides complaining that the government was not conservative enough, they have: - asserted that the (approx. 500,000) Shiites in the Kingdom are apostates, a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law brings the death penalty. Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin), isn't he Ilyess? - called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who drove in public a while back to protest the ban on women driving. The guy from the group who said this, Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri, said that these women should be fired from their jobs, jailed, and branded as prostitutes. Is this what you want to see happen, Ilyess? I've heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving has no basis in the Qur'an, the ahadith, etc. Yet these folks not only like the ban, they want these women falsely called prostitutes? If I were you, I'd choose my heroes wisely, Ilyess, not just reflexively rally behind anyone who hates anyone you hate. - say that women should not be allowed to work. - say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom. Now, the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government on earth; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot, among other things. I just think that the most likely replacements for them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country. But I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately. In the last six months or so I've read there have been stepped up harassing by the muttawain (religious police---*not* government) of Western women not fully veiled (something stupid for women to do, IMO, because it sends the wrong signals about your morality). And I've read that they've cracked down on the few, home-based expartiate religious gatherings, and even posted rewards in (government-owned) newspapers offering money for anyone who turns in a group of expartiates who dare worship in their homes or any other secret place. So the government has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of the wind out of the sails of the more-conservative opposition. As unislamic as some of these things are, they're just a small taste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House of Saud, like they're trying to in the long run. Is this really what you (and Rached and others in the general west-is-evil-zionists-rule-hate-west-or-you-are-a-puppet crowd) want, Ilyess? -- Dave Bakken ==>"the President is doing a fine job, but the problem is we don't know what to do with her husband."

Biden's statement were quoted by the Washington Post today: Let me put it plainly, Mr. Secretary. You are required to speak diplomatically; I am not. I cannot even begin to express to you my contempt for a European policy that is now asking us to participate in what amounts to a codification of the Serbian victory. ... What you have encountered is a discouraging mosaic of indifference, timidity, self-delusion and hypocrisy. ... After they held our coats on Kuwait and Somalia, they are asking us to put in a few thousand troops on the ground in order to have the right to speak and in order to implement their new idea of 'safe havens' for the Bosnians... Let's not mince words. European policy is based on cultural and religious indifference, if not bigotry. And I think it's fair to say that this would be an entirely different situation if the Muslims were doing what the Serbs have done, if this was Muslim aggression instead of Serbian aggression. Too bad the Washington Post did not include his next sentence, which pointed out that a consequence of such policy is a rising anger within the Islamic world, the consequences of which we cannot begin to predict. Later, Biden told a reporter why he spoke out: I think someone has to respond to Europe to make it clear this is a big deal... so they will understand. and it IS a big deal. By refusing the fundamental human right of self-defense to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Europe and the world have aided the Serbian aggression. Moreover, the arms embargo has forced a situation in which Bosnian Serbs have 10 times more heavy weaponry than Bosnian Croats and Muslims combined. Under such conditions, it is very easy for Serbs to play a "divide-and-conquer" game, and to get the Muslims and Croats (who have strong common interests and who were allied against the Serbian aggression) to start fighting each other, which leads to their mutual catastrophe. One final quote: U.S. Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, has said in Rome last week that "In practice, the embargo had the opposite effect intended. It made aggression certain." All diplomats who deluded themselves that they could negotiate peace while enforcing a 10:1 imbalance of power on the ground have contributed to this tragedy. Sincerely, -Josip	1

Which makes an interesting point. People living in a Jewish State have shown that Jewish culture includes in it Jewish religion but they are not the same. So, the Jewish people living in the Jewish State have shown us that there are some problems in a State where 80% of the people is secular but Judaism is define according to religious standards, or where marriage is a religious stage, or where the Law of Return defines a Jew according to a religious standard. Did those Israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become non-Jews?

The London-based and Saudi-owned Al Sharq Al Awsat daily newspaper reported Thursday in a dispatch from Riyadh that the Higher Council of Ulema (Muslim scholars) on Wednesday had unanimously proclaimed the formation of the group illegitimate and unacceptable. In a statement issued in the Saudi capital, the council, Saudi Arabia's highest religious authority, said it ``unanimously proclaims illegitimate the creation of this committee and the inadmissibility of endorsing it because the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is guided by God's sharia (law) and the Islamic courts are widespread nationwide.'' The statement said no one in the kingdom is prevented from taking grievances to those courts or to other concerned authorities and that ``the authors of the bulletin (announcing the founding of the committee) are well aware of this.''

Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island since 1571. And the next is 'Karabag'. The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop Makarios. The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct. THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM 2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus It is the house of Dr. Nihat Ilhan, a major who was serving at the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent. During the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat Ilhan's wife and three children were ruthlessly and brutally killed in the bathroom, where they had tried to hide, by savage Greeks. Dr. Nihat Ilhan happened to be on duty that night, the 24th December 1963. Pictures reflecting Greek atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum. AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS The date is the 24th of December, 1963... The onslaught of the Greeks against the Turks, which started three days ago, has been going on with all its ferocity; and defenseless women, old men and children are being brutally killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed... The wife and the three infant children of Dr. Nihat Ilhan, a major on duty at the camp of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent, are mercilessly and dastardly shot dead while hiding in the bathroom of their house, by maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism. Let us now listen to the relating of the said incident told by Mr. Hasan Yusuf Gudum, an eye witness, who himself was wounded during the same terrible event. "On the night of the 24th of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours Mrs. Ayshe of Mora, her daughter Ishin and Mrs. Ayshe's sister Novber were also with us. We were all sitting having supper. All of a sudden bullets from the Pedieos River direction started to riddle the house, sounding like heavy rain. Thinking that the dining-room where we were sitting was dangerous, we ran to the bathroom and toilet which we thought would be safer. Altogether we were nine persons. We all hid in the bathroom except my wife who took refuge in the toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with a great noise we heard the front door open. Greeks had come in and were combing, every corner of the house with their machine gun bullets. During these moments I heard voices saying, in Greek, "You want Taksim eh!" and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into the bath. They were shot. At this moment the Greeks, who broke into the bathroom, emptied their guns on us again. I heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted. When I came to myself 2 or 3 hours later, I saw Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the bathroom were all seriously wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the toilet, where, in the doorway, I saw her body. She was brutally murdered. In the street admist the sound of shots I heard voices crying "Help, help. Is there no one to save us?" I became terrified. I thought that if the Greeks came again and found that I was not dead they would kill me. So I ran to the bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed. An our passed by. In the distance I could still hear shots. My mouth was dry, so I came out from under the bed and drank some water. Then I put some sweets in my pocket and went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets to Mrs. Ayshe, her daughter and Mrs. Novber who were all wounded. We waited in the bathroom until 5 o'clock in the morning. I thought morning would never come. We were all wounded and needed to be taken to hospital. Finally, as we could walk, Mrs. Novber and I, went out into the street hoping to find help, and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik. There, we met some people who took us to hospital where we were operated on. When I regained my consciousness I said that there were more wounded in the house and they went and brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter. After staying three days in the hospital I was sent by plane to Ankara for further treatment. There I have had four months treatment but still I cannot use my arm. On my return to Cyprus, Greeks arrested me at the Airport. All I have related to you above I told the Greeks during my detention. They then released me." ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200 to 300 people have been slaughtered in the last five days. We were the first Western reporters there, and we saw some terrible sights. In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way into a house whose floors were covered with broken glass. A child's bicycle lay in a corner. In the bathroom, looking like a group of waxworks, were three children piled on top of their murdered mother. In a room next to it we glimpsed the body of a woman shot in the head. This, we were told, was the home of a Turkish Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence. Today was five days later, and still they lay there.

Partying does go on and it has consistently been ranked one of Playboy's top party schools. But we do study and more importantly learn a lot. The overall UVa drug use is actually lower than the average college in the U.S. There is no hate law on the books even though they (The forces of PC) tried to have one last year( by the way a similar law at the University of Wisconsin ? was found unconstitutional last year). There is a law against relationship of professors with their students or advisees that just passed. Thomas Jefferson was the sole author of the Virginia statute for religious freedom(the basis for the first ten amendments), though he is not given full credit for righting the bill of rights. So someone who picked on me for that is right. By the way, we're the man in everything. Sports academics and partying. I'm sure a lot of other schools are good at what they do as well, so don't start mailing me junk. I'm happy where I am and maybe I'll go to one of y'alls medical schools in a couple of years.	1

Coming from a self-exposed historical revisionist, a self-admitted anti-Muslim and a genocide apologist, Hamaza should take your drivel as a compliment. Furthermore, you even deny the obvious. There was a genocide of the Muslims carried out by order of the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government. Massacres of Muslims must be studied in detail, because they are the first modern example of the horrible crime of genocide. Blame must be apportioned to the Armenians and their supporters for the murder of Muslims. The Turkish historic homeland, emptied of its native population until today, remains occupied by the x-Soviet Armenian Government. Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity. x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds. The following are the Jewish and Armenian sources on the cold-blooded genocide perpetrated by the x-Soviet Armenian Government against 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914 and 1920. Still denying the obvious? Source: Stanford J. Shaw, on Armenian collaboration with invading Russian armies in 1914, "History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey (Volume II: Reform, Revolution & Republic: The Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808-1975)." (London, Cambridge University Press 1977). pp. 315-316. "In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population, closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during the next two days." "Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions, Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims. Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common soldiers began deserting in droves." "With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks, Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading Russian armies." Source: Stanford J. Shaw, "History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey," Vol II. Cambridge University Press, London, 1979, pp. 314-317. "...Meanwhile, Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans, with the president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response: 'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the glorious Russian Army, with their blood to serve the victory of Russian arms...Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the Bosporus. Let, with Your will, great Majesty, the peoples remaining under the Turkish yoke receive freedom. Let the Armenian people of Turkey who have suffered for the faith of Christ receive resurrection for a new free life under the protection of Russia.'[155] Armenians again flooded into the czarist armies.

"The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897, however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia."

"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages.

The criminal acts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government come directly under the scope of the Convention on Genocide adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 8, 1948, containing the following provisions: The Contracting Parties, having considered the declaration made by the General Assembly of the United Nations in its Resolution 95 (1) dated December 11, 1946, that genocide is a crime under international law, contrary to the spirit and aims of the United Nations and condemned by the civilized world; Recognizing that in all periods of history genocide has inflicted great losses on humanity; and Being convinced that, in order to liberate mankind from such odious scourge, international cooperation is required; Members agree as hereinafter provided: Article 1. The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish. Article 2. In the present Convention genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: A) Killing member of the group; B) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; C) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; D) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; E) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group; Article 3. The following acts shall be punishable: a) Genocide b) Conspiracy to commit genocide c) Direct and public incitement to commit genocide d) Attempt to commit genocide. Article 4. Persons committing genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in Article 3 shall be punished, whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private individuals. Had the Convention on Genocide existed before the Armenian massacres of the Turks and Kurds, it would probably have been difficult for the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its responsibles to start murdering of civilian, defenseless, faithful Ottoman citizens, children and women, (GENOCIDE AND ATTEMPT TO GENOCIDE), to make plans to exterminate, as they have done also to Urartus and Jews, faithful Ottoman citizens (CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT GENOCIDE), to incite Armenians to armed revolt against the legal authority and to commit Genocide, (DIRECT AND PUBLIC INCITEMENT TO COMMIT GENOCIDE).

Now the genocide of the truth by the criminal/Nazi Armenians? Not a chance. Source: "Men Are Like That" by Leonard Ramsden Hartill. The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Indianapolis (1926). (305 pages). (Memoirs of an Armenian officer who participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people) "Foreword:" "For example, we were camped one night in a half-ruined Tartar mosque, the most habitable building of a destroyed village, near the border of Persia and Russian Armenia. During the course of evening I asked Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and the cause of its destruction. In his matter of fact way he replied, Yes, I assisted in its sack and destruction, and witnessed the slaying of those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins." p. 202 (first and second paragraphs). "We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead." p. 15 (second paragraph). "The Tartars were, for the most part, poor. Some of them lived in villages and cultivated small farms; many of them continued in the way of life of their nomadic forefathers. They drove their flocks and herds from valley to valley, from plain to mountain, and from mountain to plain, following the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. They ranged from the salt desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains. Even the village Tartars are a primitive people, only semicivilized." "I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars, and, while holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country, regarded and treated them as inferiors. The fact that the Russians looked down upon all Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars, far from proving a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors, intensified an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility." p. 20 (second paragraph). "Our men armed themselves, gathered together and advanced on the Tartar section of the village. There were no lights in the houses and the doors were barred, for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great fear. Our men hammered on the doors, but got no response; whereupon they smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last Tartar was slain. Throughout the hideous night, I cowered at home in terror, unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and the loud shouts of our men. By morning the work was finished." p. 109 (second paragraph). "As things were, the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself incompetent to rule by legitimate means. The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and outside the law. When they became a legally instituted, recognized governing body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands, they proved incompetent to do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days. The outstanding feature of their rule, now that they were in power, was, as in the old days, trial and execution without hearing. A man evoking the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. The method of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back of his head and blow out his brains. This simple way of getting rid of those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became a common way of paying debts." p. 203 (first paragraph). "A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar. I saw the point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...Another soldier seized a rock and pounded the Tartar's head with it... The Armenian who had bayoneted him sprang to his feet, wrested the weapon from the Tartar's body, and, raising it to his lips, licked it clean of blood, exclaiming in Russian, 'Slodkey! Slodkey!' (Sweet.)" p. 203 (second paragraph). "One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village. Among the ruins a fire was burning. I went to the fire and saw seated about it a group of soldiers. Among them were two Tartar girls, mere children. The girls were crouched on the ground, crying softly with suppressed sobs. Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes. There were also bodies of the dead." p. 204 (first paragraph). "I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying, I entered the yard of a house, which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a year old." p. 118. "Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging them with shrill Tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the carts, the women, veiled as is the Tartar way, held children in their arms. Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot. Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety. This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene.... That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted and completely destroyed." p. 192. "Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced.... They entered into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores that had been left by the Turks." p. 193. "Terrible vengeance was taken upon Tartars, Kurds and Turks. Their villages were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country." p. 195. "The fanatical Dashnacks hated the Turks above all others and then in order of diminishing intensity: Tartars, Kurds and Russians." p. 218. (First and second paragraphs) "Russian troops did terrible things in the Turkish villages...We Armenians did not spare the Tartars....If persisted in, the slaughtering of prisoners, the looting, and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace actions expected and accepted as a matter of course. I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground, in numbers, like the fallen leaves in a forest. They had been as helpless and as defenseless as sheep. They had not died as soldiers die in the heat of battle, fired with ardor and courage, with weapons in their hands, and exchanging blow for blow. They had died as the helpless must, with their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself." p. 133 (first paragraph) "In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians abandoned the struggle. During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the brutality displayed, but could not make any effective protest. Some, mercifully, were shot. Many of them were burned to death. The method employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut, and then after crowding the hut with Turks, set fire to the straw." p. 19 (first paragraph) "The Tartar section of the town no longer existed, except as a pile of ruins. It had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered. The same fate befell the Tartar section of Khankandi." p. 22 (second paragraph) "Many of our men had served in the Russian Army, and were trained soldiers. We Armenians were rich and possessed arms. Tartars had never received military training. They were poor, and possessed few arms beyond knives. ...Shortly after the killing of the Tartars in our village, the revolution in Russia was suppressed." p. 97 (third paragraph) "Within a few years, following the beginning of the movement, an invisible government of Armenians by Armenians had been established in Turkish Armenia in armed opposition to the Turkish Government. This secret government had its own courts and laws and an army of assassins called 'Mauserists' (professional killers) to enforce its decrees." p. 98 (first paragraph) "The Dashnacks were in continual open rebellion against the Turkish Government." p. 98 (third paragraph) "...the Dashnacks engineered a general revolt of Armenians in Turkish Armenia under the mistaken belief that European nations would intervene and secure independence for Turkish Armenia." p. 99 (second paragraph) "The Dashnacks were fanatics." p. 99 (third paragraph) "The Dashnacks took advantage of this situation and extended their revolutionary activities into the Russian province. They instituted a campaign of terrorism and employed threats and force in securing contributions to the party funds from rich Armenians. A wealthy man would be assessed a stipulated sum. Refusal to pay brought upon him a sentence of death. Every member of the party was pledged to carry out orders without question. If a man were to be assassinated, lots might be drawn to select an executioner or the job might be assigned to one of the 'mauserists' of the party." p. 130 (first paragraph) "...in moments of victory against Turks and Kurds or Tartars, they [Armenians] have been remorseless in seeking vengeance." p. 130 (third paragraph) "The city was a scene of confusion and terror. During the early days of the war, when the Russian troops invaded Turkey, large numbers of the Turkish population abandoned their homes and fled before the Russian advance." p. 159 (second paragraph) "I made a cannon, a huge gun to lift which required four men. I made balls for it. With my cannon the Armenians could knock down any of the Tartar houses and so they were able to drive the Tartars out." p. 181 (first paragraph) "The Tartar villages were in ruins." p. 189 (third paragraph) "The dead Tartar lay with his head in a pool of mud and blood, his beard still setaceous and now crimsoned."

As I stated, religion There are various contradictory views on the origin of the Armenians. The name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form 'Armina' or 'Aramaniya' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument. The following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun cuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb (510 B.C.). 1. The monarch Dara said: I sent my servant to Arminam 'Armeniya'. 6. On reaching Arminam 'Armeniya'. 7. To the country town of Zozo, to Armaniya 'Armeniya'. According to Karakashian: As for 'Armenia', the equivalent of the 'Armin' or 'Arminik' of the Persians, this is more recent than the word 'Ararat', and is to be found used in the Dara inscriptions for 'Haiastan'. Saint Martin: The name 'Armenie' has been given since very early times by almost all the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians as 'Haiastan'. It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs as Ermeniyye. Others believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as 'Harminap' which was later modified by the Persians to 'Arminia'. 'Ar' refers to a place, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror, while 'men' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and therefore 'Armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place'. G. Alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary "Haik" is the diminutive form of "Hai", and that "Hai" is the name of our nation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word "Armen" that foreigners apply to our people.' It would thus appear that 'Armenia' is a place-name, that 'Armen' is the name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way connected with the word 'Hai'. Haik and Haiastan: Armenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom the Armenian people took the name 'Hai'. But the mere resemblance between the words 'Haik' and 'Hai' constitutes no real proof, and, in any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of Khoren. Haiasa: The following studies show quite clearly that 'Hai' and 'Haiasa' were no more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the region known as Armenia. Professor Hachadurian: 'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite inscriptions for Upper Armenia.' Yensen, in his 'Hittites and Armenians' tries to prove that 'Hai' is identical with the Hittite 'Hatio', in other words that 'Hai' is a Hittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown that 'Hai' was derived from 'Hatio'. Mortman's attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with no success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it. The resemblance between the words 'Haiasa' and 'Haiastan' is so obvious that we may well accept 'Haiasa' as the oldest form of 'Haiastan'. Let us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'Hai', 'Haikazan' and 'Haiastan' entered our older works. According to Karakashian: 'The word "Haik" is never to be found employed with reference to a leader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it ever found employed in the forms "Haika" or "Haykazn". Agahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he improved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred to a nation and had been derived from "Hai" or "Haik" they could also have used the words "Haikak" and "Haykazn" in a number of places.' According to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite inscriptions: 'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality or species. The words "Haddanas", "Haddina" were used by the Assyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the "d" between the two "a" letters to "y" "Hadinasdani" was in this way transformed to "Haiastan"'. Professor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'Hai' and 'Haistan' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'Haiasa' which is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards. Forrer takes 'Haiasa' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case it seems likely that 'Haiasa' was actually a part of Armenia. The suffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is 'Hayasa', which refers to the country of the 'Hayasas'. E. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological and Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people. The Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost all of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark, above average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties with certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples. According to J. Deniker: From the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be regarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are descended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their average height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region. They are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of 85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic family. Professor Rene Vernont writes as follows: The Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols, but some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a little above average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often a hooked nose and a rather wide mouth. Investigations carried out by N. Kossovitch on the links between Armenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics led him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a distinct race.

The Greeks started massacring the Turkish population on Cyprus in 1974. In 1974, Turkiye stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately, the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority. The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop Makarios. The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct. Turkish Cypriots are simply seeking guarantees that will preclude a repeat performance by the fanatical cadres of the Greeks' EOKA. If such assurances are not perfectly implemented, there is every reason to expect that the local Greeks will be misguided enough to perpetrate their past mistakes. On such an occasion, the Turkish side may not find it satisfactory to act with reluctance to go any further than before, for it is unacceptable to remain always defensive against cyclical vicious attacks. Therefore it would be better to have a true federation of two separate sections living in obligatory peace, rather than another armed confrontation that would be started by the Greeks and obligatorily but decisively terminated by the Turks. The present Greek government is trying to tyrannize the Turkish population in western Thrace by forbidding it its ethnic and religious rights, which were established through international treaties. One might be better advised to remember that misadventures against Turkiye do not serve Greece well. An offer of membership in the European Common Market as bait for concessions that may doom the Turks in Cyprus to extinction is not a viable course for Greece or her friends. Neither Turkish lives nor Turkish honor has been placed on the bidding block to be sold for commercial gain.

This is not a fresh case of I don't have the faintest idea what literature it is to which you refer. Is this an explicit statement by some document? Or is it your interpretation of statements in such literature? Or is this a figment of your imagination or a Nazi Armenian propaganda movie script? In any case, a fascinating piece of analysis. Here are the facts: Source: Walker, Christopher: "Armenia: The Survival of a Nation." New York (St. Martin's Press), 1980. This generally pro-Armenian work contains the following information of direct relevance to the Nazi Holocaust: a) Dro (the butcher), the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the architect of the genocide of 2.5 million Muslims, the most respected of Nazi Armenian leaders, established an Armenian Provisional Republic in Berlin during World War II; b) this 'provisional government' fully endorsed and espoused the social theories of the Nazis, declared themselves and all Armenians to be members of the Aryan 'Super-Race;' c) they published an Anti-Semitic, racist journal, thereby aligning themselves with the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews; and, d) they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to 30,000 members which fought side by side with the Wehrmacht. In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional Record,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps, the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 30,000-strong under the command of Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination of the Jews. This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an "encore" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Muslims by colluding with the invading Russian army.

A post in another group, on the Bosnian war, asked us all to love each other, that love would conquer hate. Sadly, I remember a TV interview with a young woman in Sarajevo (sp?) who was as I remember, a former olympic calibre contestant in the rifle shoot. She was now trying to pick-off Serbian snipers. During the communist years she had married a Serb, who was now fighting against her people. So it seems that hate will conquer love. Is there an odd chance that we might all forget past wrongs and try and see how we might all live together?

Odishe Liyetze on the Turkish front, he wrote, "On the nights 11-12 March, 1918 alone Armenian butchers bayoneted and axed to death 3000 Muslims in areas surrounding Erzincan. These barbars threw their victims into pits, most likely dug according to their sinister plans to extinguish Muslims, in groups of 80. My adjutant counted and unearthed 200 such pits. This is an act against our world of civilization." On March 12, 1918 Lieut-colonel Griyaznof wrote (from an official Russian account of the Turkish genocide), "Roads leading to villages were littered with bayoneted torsos, dismembered joints and carved out organs of Muslim peasants... alas! mainly of women and children." Source: Doc. Dr. Azmi Suslu, "Russian View on the Atrocities Committed by the Armenians Against the Turks," Ankara Universitesi, Ankara, 1987, pp. 45-53. "Document No: 77," Archive No: 1-2, Cabin No: 10, Drawer No: 4, File No: 410, Section No: 1578, Contents No: 1-12, 1-18. (Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War, Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov) "The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian was permitted to approach the city and its environs. While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers who had remained in the rear during the war. One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud, and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud and dirt... It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently. Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days. The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned. ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief, Odishelidge. They were as follows: The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades... More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses: 'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when the hole was full it would be covered over with soil. The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one. Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and destroyed the entire population, together with the villages. During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with hatred and loathing. Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot. Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following: There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads. Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age, children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder. A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle, instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers, the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and claimed they had laughed because they were nervous. An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command narrated the following incident which took place on February 20: The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head. The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people among this group were able to save their lives as the result of my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered on the streets. On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for murdering an innocent Turk. When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act. However no result was achieved. In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre. However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority. Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians. You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear of the Turkish soldiers. The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real nature of the Armenian ideology. Nothing which is already done can be undone."

(Sahak Melkonian - 1920 - "Preserving the Armenian purity") "The crime of systematic cleansing by mass killing and extermination of the Muslim population in Soviet Republic of Armenia, Karabag, Bosnia and Herzegovina is an 'Islamic Holocaust' comparable to the extermination of 2.5 million Muslims by the Armenian Government during the WWI and of over 6 million European Jews during the WWII."

Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack on the part of the Jews, and a massacre defines it best in my opinion. The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with the Jews, a peace pact, but the Irgun purposely broke this agreement in order to scare off the Palestinians. I might grant that this village housed armed Arabs [I doubt it] but nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that this was a motivating force amongst the Irgun. The Deir Yassin MASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the Palestinians to flee the Jewish Homeland.,...and contrary to your belief, many civilians were killed. Deir Yassin was later advertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was useful in getting many Palestinians to leave. The Palestinians were rightfully scared off, because they did not want another Deir Yassin. I'm not necessarily condemning the Israelites here; atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the Arabs. Israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are and were the good guys in the middle east. Both Arab and Jew suck equally. rj3s, you say that there is no evidence that what motivated the Irgun to attack Dir Yassin was its strategic importance. In fact, Begin, who was in charge of the Irgun, wrote that Dir Yassin was attacked for its military significance. Dir Yassin was merely a battle in the War of Liberation. People died. But the thing was never intended to be a masacre. That this hapenned is a tragedy of war - not a crime of the Irgun. Harry.	1

The falsity of this statement is easily visible in the intellectual corruption that dominates everything you post in this group. Your complete lack of objectivity toward Israel, and Jewish identity in general, reveal biases that indicate a great steaming heap of hatred! You certainly have shown a genuine hatred for honesty and for objectivity. You repeatedly post items or quotes removed from their original context so that they can be used to further an agenda of rabid opposition to the very existence of Israel. You have used this dishonest technique to paint a false image of several Israeli leaders. I can't say if you actually HATE these leaders, but the lies and misrepresentations of them do suggest that you have a visceral prejudice against them. So, while you claim that you do not hate anybody, there is an ample body of evidence to suggest that this claim of yours is false. It is obvious that you hate Israel, and it is evident that you hate the Jewish people. And, if you are Jewish, you are a self-hating Jew. There can be no doubt of this. Although you will call upon your Jewish background in an effort to claim the high moral ground, there is no doubt that you would like to see the Jewish people fade away completely, as a people. Your advocacy of intermarriage for the purpose of dissolving the Jewish people is proof that you hate the Jewish people. And by your effort to superimpose the meaninglessness of your own Jewishness on all Jews, you've clearly demonstrated to me that you hate yourself. * * * * "Who is a Jew?

Source: Professor Stanford J. Shaw, 'The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic,' New York University Press, New York (1991). pages 202-203: <<In 1865, immediately after enactment of the new Organic Statute for the Jewish community, and just as Jewish capital from Europe was beginning to have an effect in Istanbul, local Armenians and Greeks started a pogrom against Jews immediately across the sea of Marmara at Haydarpasa, terminus of the Anatolia railroad, with three hundred Jews massacred and many more beaten and raped before the disturbance was stopped after the Sultan sent his personal guard across the bay to protect the Jews [39]. In later years, ritual murder attacks against Jews, carried out mostly by native Greeks, Armenians, and, in Arab provinces, by Maronites and other Arab Christians, often with the assistance of the local European consuls, took place throughout the empire. There were literally thousands of incidents continuously until World War I, in Southeastern Europe as far west and north as Monastir and Kavalla, in Istanbul, at Gallipoli and the Dardanelles, at Salonica, and in all the Arab provinces as far south as Damascus and Beirut and in Egypt at Cairo and Alexandria. These invariably resulted from accusations spread among Ottoman Christians by word of mouth, or published in their newspapers, often by Christian financiers and merchants anxious to get their Jewish competitors out of the way or to divert onto the Jews Muslim anger at reports of Christian massacres of Muslims in Southeastern Europe or Central Asia, resulting in individual and mob attacks on Jews, and the burning of their shops and homes. Individual experiences were horrible. Jews constantly went in fear of Armenian or Greek attacks in the streets of Ottoman cities. In Egypt and Syria, it was usually the Greeks who led the way, in many cases with the assistance of local Armenians and Syrian Christians, whose Greek, Arabic and French-language newspapers often printed all the rumors they could find regarding Jews, evidently with the desire of instigating violence. The Syrian Arab Christians in particular spread their long-standing anti-Semitic hatreds from Syria to Egypt, where their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes such as Egyptian nationalism and opposition to the British rule, enabled them to spread their anti-Jewish message among the Muslim masses with little question or opposition. On 20 June 1890, thus, Sir Evelyn Baring (later Lord Cromer), British High Commissioner in Egypt, received the following report from David and Nissim Ades, in Cairo: ''Sir, I beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which has (sic) appeared in an Arabic paper called El Mahroussa which contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the Jews, especially those (the issues) of the 14th, 17th and 19th instant. Now, Sir, are we to have here an anti-Semitic party amidst fanaticism, Greeks, Armenians, etc., or is he to be allowed to continue to poison the people's minds with exaggeration and painted words? In an article, he asserted that the Jews use Christian blood for Passover, of course this has caused a deal of excitement.'' [40] Whenever Greek and other Orthodox religious authorities or prominent Greek business leaders or consuls were asked to help to stem the violence or reduce tension, they invariably indicated their cooperation and then failed to do anything to prevent attacks or punish those who stimulated or led them. [41] The leader of the Ashkenazi community of Corlu complained to the president of AIU [Alliance Israelite Universelle] in 1902 about persistent Greek attacks against its Jewish quarter: ''The fanatic Greeks of our city, as of other places in Thrace, have the habit of, contrary to the spirit of real Christianity, making a replica of Judas Iscariote and of burning it on the night of Holy Saturday.

Assoc.,Nazareth The Arab Association for Human Rights P.O. Box 215 Nazareth, 16101 Israel Phone (972)-6-561923 Fax (972)-6-564934 The Arab Association for Human Rights (HRA) was formed in 1988 to address discriminatory practices and human rights abuses by Israel against its Palestinian citizens. It is a unique association concerned with the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian national minority in Israel. Among the issues of concern are land confiscation, education, prison conditions, unemployment, torture and the unequal allocation of Israel's resources. Today there are around 800,000 Palestinian Arabs living within the Green line (the pre-1967 borders of Israel), constituting 18% of Israel's citizens. For them it is an empty citizenship in a system geared exclusively for the needs of the Jewish population. Legally and practically, Israel has proclaimed itself a Jewish state and early promises of equality for non-Jewish citizens have not been fulfilled. This is apparent in many areas strongly affecting the Palestinian national minority. Most Arab agricultural land has been confiscated since 1948. The Arab sector is vastly underfunded and does not receive a fair share of state resources. On a day-to- day level, Palestinians face discrimination in many different forms and find it is a struggle to get permission to build a house, start a business, find a job or educate their children. ACTIVITIES - Monitoring civil, economic, cultural and human rights abuses of Palestinians within the Green Line. - Taking carefully selected test cases to court. - Providing legal advice and assistance to lawyers in the Occupied Territories. - Educating the Palestinian public as to their rights and methods of mobilization. - Conducting public campaigns on local and international levels. - Researching and publishing pertinent publications.	1

Le Merde added that up to 1992, Cosar operated out of tygra.michigan.com, but escaped from the country when Bullshit bikers entered the city. It was about this time that a statement issued by BMFALFSW claimed that Mr. Cosar was dead of wounds suffered during a mailbombing by bdb@becker.gts.org, although it is generally believed that the mysterious leader is alive and well and presently is residing alternately in Fuckersville, Bullshitia, and Zuma, Stupidia. The paper also noted that the communist government of Sexual Maniac Hasan B. Mutlu and his F.U.C.K.A.L.L party accepted the Zumabot's underground leader with "open arms" and still providing him with assistance in exchange for pornographic material. Le Merde further adds that BMFALFSW derives only a small portion of its expenditures from wealthy drug lords who support the cause, with the rest coming either from other sources or from proceeds of an involvement in child-porn trafficking."

The Hirgun, and other branch - off militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of Palestine. Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the Arabs. These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in favor of a compromise with the Palestinians. The Irgun killed SOLDIERS, which is a legitimate way to drive an unwanted fogriend regime from a country. They didn't kill blindly their families or such (not as a policy, I agree that brits which were not soldiers also were killed sometimes) nor they killed Arabs just for being Arabs. In case I have to remind you the difference, the majority of the attacks of the Arab terrorist organizations was on civilians. They even tried to justify their attacks by saying that all Jews in the Israel served in the army at one point in time or another and therefore are legitimate targets. In addition, they massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their very lives. Yes, these exceptions were tragic mistakes. I wasn't there and don't have reffereces handy but from what I heard your description is a bit carried away, most of the vilagers fled with several dozens, most of them claimed to be fighters being killed. Those "massaceres" are far from being the rule considering that dozens if not hounders of Arab vilages came under Israeli rule during the same time period. I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the Israelites pisses me off so. I'm not as critical of the Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the Jews. It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for German and European anti semitism. What do you mean "screwed over by the Jews"? They began the '47 war and didn't accept the arrgenment planned by the U.N., what did you expect the Jews to do??

Just put this line into your >global kill file: Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin? Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian Armenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines genocide as acting with a 'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.' History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established, beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian territories. The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed. The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian Government. The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were Dro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri, Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.

Israel's #1 issue is "Security" so *any* outcomes of "negotiation" certainly need to address ISREAL'S perception of this issue. The problem is is defining (by "outsiders", by Israel, and by the Arabs themselves) what is the #1 issue to the Arab side. Is it "Palestinian statehood", is it that Israel as a state should not and must not be allowed to exist, is it that the existence of a self-governing non- muslim "state" in the "Islamic World" is intolerable...what? Just as the dividing line between Israel-fighting-for-security and Israel-fighting- to-expand is often hard to discern by "outsiders" (especially to the Arab world), so the rationale behind the Arab-struggle-to-undermine-Israel-in- any-way could either be based on visceral rejectionism or a sense of being wronged that still values peace, who knows which.

Will anybody A typical Armenian revisionist. As in the past in x-Soviet Armenia, and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and idiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. A short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious for the region. As usual, they will be treated accordingly by their neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely within Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to x-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is the historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary heritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous, even lunatic. No one in his or her mind could have imagined that one day such a devious turn of event could have plagued the Azeris. One cannot even imagine the reverse case to occur, for the Armenians either would have slaughtered the Azerbaijanis, or put them to forced exile to maintain their own majority. Where was she? An Appeal to Mankind During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums, documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated. The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace. The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded. Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland. Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan. Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations. One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR. We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance, for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated, its territory, culture and history are trampled, its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States. One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan. It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR. We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade. But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000 Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the neighboring lands. The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales, suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent. But what about the lives of seven million human beings? If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other attributes? All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins. THE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE'S HELP TO KARABAKH (OF THE) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE AZERBAIJAN SSR "PAINFUL SEARCH .." THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town of Hojali is at last emerging in Azerbaijan - about 600 men, women and children dead in the worst outrage of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh. The figure is drawn from Azeri investigators, Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates. The 25 February attack on Hojali by Armenian forces was one of the last moves in their four-year campaign to take full control of Nagorny Karabakh, the subject of a new round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and a massacre, but investigators say that most of the dead were civilians. The awful number of people killed was first suppressed by the fearful former Communist government in Baku. Later it was blurred by Armenian denials and grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild and contradictory allegations of up to 2,000 dead. The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov, the cheif investigator of a 15-man team looking into what Azerbaijan calls the "Hojali Disaster", said his figure of 600 people dead was a minimum on preliminary findings. A similar estimate was given by Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper Ordu in May - 479 dead people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified. This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence. FranCois Zen Ruffinen, head of delegation of the International Red Cross in Baku, said the Muslim imam of the nearby city of Agdam had reported a figure of 580 bodies received at his mosque from Hojali, most of them civilians. "We did not count the bodies. But the figure seems reasonable. It is no fantasy," Mr Zen Ruffinen said. "We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead." Mr Rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the number of dead in the massacre. "Don't get worked up. It will take several months to get a final figure," the 43-year-old lawyer said at his small office. Mr Rasulov knows about these things. It took him two years to reach a firm conclusion that 131 people were killed and 714 wounded when Soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990. Those nationalists, the Popular Front, finally came to power three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly what happened when Hojali, an Azeri town which lies about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians. Officially, 184 people have so far been certified as dead, being the number of people that could be medically examined by the republic's forensic department. "This is just a small percentage of the dead," said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. "They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours." Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old. Gunshots killed 151 people, shrapnel killed 20 and axes or blunt instruments killed 10. Exposure in the highland snows killed the last three. Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears, noses, breasts or penises cut off and eyes gouged out, according to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said. Files from Mr Rasulov's investigative commission are still disorganised - lists of 44 Azeri militiamen are dead here, six policemen there, and in handwriting of a mosque attendant, the names of 111 corpses brought to be washed in just one day. The most heartbreaking account from 850 witnesses interviewed so far comes from Towfiq Manafov, an Azeri investigator who took a helicopter flight over the escape route from Hojali on 27 February. "There were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500 in Hojali, 650-700 people by the stream and the road and 85-100 visible around Nakhchivanik village," Mr Manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter pilot. "People waved up to us for help. We saw three dead children and one two-year-old alive by one dead woman. The live one was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to return." There has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces. THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92 HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES AREF SADIKOV sat quietly in the shade of a cafe-bar on the Caspian Sea esplanade of Baku and showed a line of stitches in his trousers, torn by an Armenian bullet as he fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope. "I'm still wearing the same clothes, I don't have any others," the 51-year-old carpenter said, beginning his account of the Hojali disaster. "I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive." Mr Sadikov and his wife were short of food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They sensed the Armenian noose was tightening around the 2,000 to 3,000 people left in the straggling Azeri town on the edge of Karabakh. "At about 11pm a bombardment started such as we had never heard before, eight or nine kinds of weapons, artillery, heavy machine-guns, the lot," Mr Sadikov said. Soon neighbours were pouring down the street from the direction of the attack. Some huddled in shelters but others started fleeing the town, down a hill, through a stream and through the snow into a forest on the other side. To escape, the townspeople had to reach the Azeri town of Agdam about 15 miles away. They thought they were going to make it, until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak. "None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a car on the road, and the Armenian outposts started opening fire," Mr Sadikov said. Azeri militiamen fighting their way out of Hojali rushed forward to force open a corridor for the civilians, but their efforts were mostly in vain. Mr Sadikov said only 10 people from his group of 80 made it through, including his wife and militiaman son. Seven of his immediate relations died, including his 67-year-old elder brother. "I only had time to reach down and cover his face with his hat," he said, pulling his own big flat Turkish cap over his eyes. "We have never got any of the bodies back." The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero of the evacuation, Alif Hajief, was shot dead as he struggled to change a magazine while covering the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said. Another hero, Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali, said he and several others spent the whole day of 26 February in the bushy hillside, surrounded by dead bodies as they tried to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay. As the survivors staggered the last mile into Agdam, there was little comfort in a town from which most of the population was soon to flee. "The night after we reached the town there was a big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just kept going," Mr Sadikov said. "I had to get to the hospital for treatment. I was in a bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock." Victims of war: An Azeri woman mourns her son, killed in the Hojali massacre in February (left). Nurses struggle in primitive conditions (centre) to save a wounded man in a makeshift operating theatre set up in a train carriage.

Under what conditions should US interfere in foregin countries, is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious accusations of religious bigotry and such. As I understand it, International law provides the right of any country to intervene to prevent genocide. I think once the World Court has ruled that genocide is being committed... If a Human Rights Czar is appointed at the U.N., we could have international monitors recording events and responses of local officials and develop an objective basis. This could be backed by adjudication at the International Court of Justice and enforcement through a Rapid Deployment Force under the U.N. Secretary General's command. I would like to see the U.N. directly impose ICJ rulings whenever feasible (without the possibility of vetos at the UN Security Council.. much as the President can't veto a U.S. Supreme Court ruling). The U.S. is now supporting the effort to appoint the HR Czar -- the third world opposition is led by three countries, China, Iran and Pakistan (What company is Pakistan keeping!). The U.S. is also reconsidering its opposition to the U.N. force initially envisaged in the Charter (although under the control of the Security Council). The UN SC is quite a flawed body. Rogue governments like the PRC have even threatened their veto in the last few months to block the move to place U.N. troops in Bosnia under Chapter 7 instead of 11 (if I have the numbers straight) where they could have moved from being a monitoring to an enforcement force without requiring further SC action. (The PRC even continues to threaten using its veto on U.N. action despite the ICJ ruling. The current set-up requires the SC to enforce ICJ rulings..). Peace, Gul Agha	1

Alberto, you've repeatedly misunderstood my postings. You are now making the exact point that I've made several times but with a different definition of religion. You don't not have to believe in the "religious" aspects of Judaism to be a Jew (this would confine Judaism to be just a religion in the sense of a Christianity.). So, by converting out of Judaism, I don't mean just not believing in the god of Judaism. I mean voluntarily removing yourself from the Jewish nation. I am an agnostic but still consider myself Jewish because of my cultural heritage. (I admit that many religious jews would argue that I am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith, but Judaism is a religion of dissent and debate isn't it?). The fact that one can opt to become Jewish simply by converting to Judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the *least* racist and most open nation. We have no quotas! So I will once again make my point. Defining a member of the Jewish nation by religion (not, as you say, religious belief) is NOT racism. You come to your incorrect conclusion because you use a different definition for religion when you define the law of return and when you define judaism. -Adam Schwartz	1

Text of President Clinton's Letter to Congress on Iranian Assets To: National Desk Contact: White House Press Office, 202-456-2100 WASHINGTON, May 14 -- Following is a letter President Clinton wrote to Congress on Iranian Assets: TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES: I hereby report to the Congress on developments since the last Presidential report on November 10, 1992, concerning the national emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in Executive Order No. 12170 of November 14, 1979, and matters relating to Executive Order No. 12613 of October 29, 1987. This report is submitted pursuant to section 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), and section 505(c) of the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9(c). This report covers events through March 31, 1993. The last report, dated November 10, 1992, covered events through October 15, 1992. 1. There have been no amendments to the Iranian Transactions Regulations ("ITRs"), 31 CFR Part 560, or to the Iranian Assets Control Regulations ("IACRs"), 31 CFR Part 535, since the last report. 2. The Office of Foreign Assets Control ("FAC") of the Department of the Treasury continues to process applications for import licenses under the ITRs. However, as previously reported, recent amendments to the ITRs have resulted in a substantial decrease in the number of applications received relating to the importation of nonfungible Iranian-origin goods. During the reporting period, the Customs Service has continued to effect numerous seizures of Iranian-origin merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the import prohibitions of the ITRs. FAC and Customs Service investi- gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions and the imposition of civil monetary penalties. Additional forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review. 3. The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (the "Tribunal"), established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers Accords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims before it. Since the last report, the Tribunal has rendered 12 awards, for a total of 545 awards. Of that total, 367 have been awards in favor of American claimants: 222 of these were awards on agreed terms, authorizing and approving payment of settlements negotiated by the parties, and 145 were decisions adjudicated on the merits. The Tribunal has issued 36 decisions dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing claims for jurisdictional reasons. Of the 59 remaining awards, 3 approved the withdrawal of cases, and 56 were in favor of Iranian claimants. As of March 31, 1993, awards to successful American claimants from the Security Account held by the NV Settlement Bank stood at $2,340,072,357.77. As of March 31, 1993, the Security Account has fallen below the required balance of $500 million 36 times. Iran has periodically replenished the account, as required by the Algiers Accords, by transferring funds from the separate account held by the NV Settlement Bank in which interest on the Security Account is deposited. Iran has also replenished the account with the proceeds from the sale of Iranian-origin oil imported into the United States, pursuant to transactions licensed on a case-by- case basis by FAC. Iran has not, however, replenished the account since the last oil sale deposit on October 8, 1992. The aggregate amount that has been transferred from the Interest Account to the Security Account is $874,472,986.47. As of March 31, 1993, the total amount in the Security Account was $216,244,986.03, and the total amount in the Interest Account was $8,638,133.15. 4. The Tribunal continues to make progress in the arbitration of claims of U.S. nationals for $250,000.00 or more. Since the last report, nine large claims have been decided. More than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been disposed of through adjudication, settlement, or voluntary withdrawal, leaving 76 such claims on the docket. The larger claims, the resolution of which has been slowed by their complexity, are finally being resolved, sometimes with sizable awards to the U.S. claimants. For example, two claimants were awarded more than $130 million each by the Tribunal in October 1992. 5. As anticipated by the May 13, 1990, agreement settling the claims of U.S. nationals for less than $250,000.00, the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission ("FCSC") has continued its review of 3,112 claims. The FCSC has issued decisions in 1,201 claims, for total awards of more than $22 million. The FCSC expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining claims in early 1994. 6. In coordination with concerned Government agencies, the Department of State continues to present United States Government claims against Iran, as well as responses by the United States Government to claims brought against it by Iran. In November 1992, the United States filed 25 volumes of supporting information in case B/1 (Claims 2 & 3), Iran's claim against the United States for damages relating to its Foreign Military Sales Program. In February of this year, the United States participated in a daylong prehearing conference in several other cases involving military equipment. Iran also filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure of U.S. courts to enforce an award against a U.S. corporation violated the Algiers Accords. 7. As reported in November, Jose Maria Ruda, President of the Tribunal, tendered his resignation on October 2, 1992. No successor has yet been named. Judge Ruda's resignation will take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up his duties. 8. The situation reviewed above continues to involve important diplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the United States and its nationals. Iran's policy behavior presents challenges to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The IACRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12170 continue to play an important role in structuring our relationship with Iran and in enabling the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords. Similarly, the ITRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12613 continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter- national terrorism. I shall exercise the powers at my disposal to deal with these problems and will report periodically to the Congress on significant developments. WILLIAM J.

Can it be that criminal/Nazi Armenians of ASALA/SDPA/ARF hate Muslims for ideological reasons regardless of what they do? Between 1914 and 1920, your criminal Armenian grandparents committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all conceivable methods of despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol over babies and burned them, raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound hand and foot, took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate. And today, they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history. Source: The Times, 2 March 1992 CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO INVESTIGATE THE MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS... As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts of the hills. The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death or missing... Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire. We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired repeated blasts. Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on "our side". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission. Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters were there to give covering fire if necessary. The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani official told us that there were now five former Soviet military helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. "They have signed contracts to fly for us," he said. The helicopter we engaged in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian pilot, but fighting for the Armenians. We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed. Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor mortis. They had been shot. What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

The conditions were wonderful, thanks to our Armenians, who received us. But it's not relaxing all the same. I don't know how everyone else feels about it, but for me it's torture. We don't have a place to call our own. I had a two bedroom apartment in Sumgait, my children went to school and we lived well, in friendship. It's painful that in our times, in 1988, in the Soviet period, people can break into our apartment and try to kill me and my children, in whom I've put all my efforts and my whole youth. Everything was going well for us: my older daughter was studying at the Institute, the middle one was preparing to enter medical school and was interning as an orderly, and my youngest had been sick for a long time, but had returned to health. I have been though a lot in my life: it's been seven years since I lost my husband, I raised my children by myself. Lots of women have similar fates, but there's nothing to be done about it. But I can't control myself when I remember what happened in Sumgait on February 27, 28, and 29, it was just a horror, it's indescribable. On February 27 our relative, Ira, came to visit us. She's better friends with my oldest daughter, and so right away she asked, "Where's Vika?" I say, "Vika's off in Pirkuli on a trip for three days, she's supposed to come back tomorrow." My middle daughter, Gaya, had baked a cake and we sat there talking and laughing, drinking tea. Then Gaya and Diana went to walk Ira home. They left and a few minutes went by; suddenly I hear noise. I raced out to the balcony--our balcony is right across from the bus station, we live at the corner of Mir and Druzhba Streets--I look and see that there are hoards of people near the bus station and they're all shouting something. What they're shouting I can't understand. Our neighbor is standing on his balcony, too. I ask, "Nufar, what's happened?" He says, "I don't know, I can't figure it out either." I got scared--the kids had gone outside, and I wanted to run after them, but then there was a knock at the door. I open the door and it's the kids. "Mamma," says Gayane, "you'll never believe what's going on out there! It's awful!" Ira says, "Aunt Zina, they're shouting, 'Karabagh! Karabagh! Karabagh is ours!' We didn't know what was going on. They're threatening to drive out the Armenians and slaughter them." I called my brother, and his wife answered the phone. I said, "Aunt Tamara, don't worry, Ira is staying here with us, and we'll see her home later." I couldn't shut my eyes all night long, even until morning. I was worried about Vika. My God, what was going on, what had happened?! -Gayane: That day, on the 27th, we stood on the balcony and observed what was happening, although Mamma wouldn't allow us to watch all of it. There weren't 50 yards between our building and the bus station. We could see and hear everything perfectly. They were stopping buses, dragging people out, leading all the passengers out, looking for Armenians. If they found an Armenian on the bus, then it started . . .I don't know what to call it . . . -Zinaida: It's called slaughter. -Gayane: The mob would descend on people and beat them. I don't know if they were killing them or not, but when they left them, they lay still, not moving, as though nothing was left of them. One person was lying there and they started dragging him. The police were standing right there, to the side, not doing anything, they didn't take any steps to calm that mob. It was awful to stand there and watch it all from the balcony. And you couldn't go anywhere, somehow . . . you wanted to be able to see everything so as to tell of it later. We wanted to leave Sumgait that day. What kept us was the idea that we live in the Soviet Union, and that something would be done about it. Where in the world was our government?! -Zinaida: We couldn't leave town, of course, because our older daughter wasn't home. And at the same time I was terrified for Gaya and Diana. On Sunday morning when I went to see Ira home, our neighbor said, "Zin', you know they went into Valodya's house and smashed everything he had. They murdered his father and two sons." Valodya is our neighbor, he's an Armenian, he lives on the first floor. I think, my God, what is happening?! And in broad daylight! I saw Ira home and when on the way back I came across a mob shouting "Slay the Armenians! Karabagh is ours!" This was at 12 o'clock in the afternoon. On the way I stopped into a bread store and the saleswoman says, "They beat our store manager, they thought he was an Armenian and they beat him, but he was an Azerbaijani." And I asked, "Did they kill him?" She says, "No, he's in serious condition." I left there and started to walk home on that same street, but the mob started moving in my direction. I turned off the street and went down the little way that goes toward the Sputnik store. There I met another crowd, but these weren't bandits, these were our people from Sumgait. I was so frightened that I walked without knowing where was going, I couldn't feel my legs or the ground under my feet. I was walking and there was a boy standing before my eyes. This was on the 27th, around evening time. He ran under our balcony, and the mob surged toward him shouting, "He's an Armenian, get him!" He wore a black coat. They grabbed him, that boy, near the bus stop, I saw it. They grabbed him by the legs and struck his head on the asphalt. I made it home but I just couldn't calm down. My oldest daughter was in my thoughts. I was thinking, my daughter's coming home now, they'll stop her bus and she'll be gone. There's no police, no protection, nothing. It's like they had all died, there's no one, nothing, no authorities whatsoever. I can't even find the words for it! I look and see an Ikarus arriving. Before going to the bus station they stop near our place, across from the Kosmos movie theater. So this Ikarus stops there and the gang is yelling, the Azerbaijanis are running toward it yelling, "Armenians out!" And I see them take the Armenians and beat them, killing them. I can't watch it any more. It was a nightmare. I just couldn't watch it. But Gaya was standing there watching it, and I scolded her. She says, "Mamma, I have to see it, I have to know what's happening, I have to see it with my own eyes so I can tell our people of it later. So our children will know." Gayane: We saw a great deal on the 27th. They caught no less than 20 people before my eyes. I can't say for sure if they killed them or not . . . -Zinaida: There were too many people there, the mob was too big. You couldn't make anything out. But I saw that boy in the black coat with my own eyes. He was 18 or 19 years old. -Gayane: I think he was older, probably, about 22. A tall fellow, a big guy, in a coat. He was walking quickly, but when they shouted that he was an Armenian, he tore off running. And the mob went after him. They caught him right under our balcony. I don't know. I don't think there could have been much left of him after that. You can imagine what happens when a crowd attacks one person. It was a mob, big, angry, and featureless. You know, there was a similarity in the way they were dressed, mostly they were wearing long black coats. You couldn't even tell them apart, they were all wearing black and they all looked alike. -Zinaida: When they picked up that boy and struck him against the asphalt and he cried "Mamma!" I ran into the room. I couldn't watch any longer. An awful lot was going on right then, in various places, it wasn't only that boy, several people were being beaten up. You couldn't see all of it at once, but when that boy cried "Mamma!" I immediately started watching only him. -Gayane: On that first day it went on from about six in the morning until twelve at night. At midnight they dispersed and the police took their place. They were scattered about in all districts. But how can you explain the fact that by morning, when it had already started getting light, around seven o'clock, our police were gone? The police disappeared and yielded their positions to the bandits. In the morning they started gathering at our inter- section again, at the bus station and at the entrance to downtown. From morning on all the roads and mass transit stops were covered, and by nine o'clock you couldn't even see the ground. There were thousands of people in the crowd. Again they began stopping vehicles and checking for Armenians. -Zinaida: They had signals. I realized that when I noticed that they made a cross with their arms, they crossed their arms over their heads. The cross, evidently, meant that the vehicle had Armenians in it. They let the Azerbaijani cars through, and they stopped the Armenian ones and started their pogrom. -Gayane: They stopped a white Zhiguli and asked the driver what his nationality was. He got out and said they were from Baku. "But what is your nationality?" He says Armenian. They immediately start shouting, "Ermeni, Ermeni!" And he says, "What's going on? I'm coming from Baku. I don't live in Sumgait." "Doesn't matter, who cares if you're from Baku or Sumgait." Anyway the crowd pounced on him and started beating him, and they dragged a woman--his wife, probably--out of the car. At this point the police came and took the two and led them away. Then the mob started smashing the car, and then burned it. The flames blazed . . . it was a horrible fire! Then everyone ran away, they thought the car was going to explode. About 20 minutes later another car comes along, a green Moskvich. They ran up shouting "Ermeni! Ermeni!" But this time they didn't pull the people out of the car, they didn't beat them. Maybe they burned them along with the car, because no one emerged from the flames. The neighbor boy Vakhit was standing on the balcony too, acquaintances of his walked by below, and he asked them and they said, "Yes, they burned them along with the car." About two hours later a whole wedding procession came by, and there was a doll on the first car. We thought they were Armenians, but the cars started to honk loudly. They were Azerbaijanis, and they were immediately allowed through. -Zinaida: The driver waved his hand as if to say 'get out of the way.' The whole crowd parted and the procession passed through freely. -Gayane: By the way, at the marriage hall, which is right in the courtyard of our building, there was a wedding that day. The Azerbaijanis were cele- brating and dancing. On the streets there was grief and death, people were being killed, and people were celebrating the whole time. -Zinaida: Before the apartment itself was attacked I asked Gaya to call and find out when the tourist bus was supposed to arrive. She went to her girlfriend's in the building, she lives in the first entryway, on the third floor. Gaya came back and said, "Mamma, the bus is supposed to come around eight, after eight." You can imagine what I was feeling, how hard it was: Vika knew nothing about what was happening and was coming to meet her death. Then I heard shouting. I raced to the window and see that the belongings of our neighbors from the second entryway are being thrown outdoors. They were thrashing about with the pillows and the feathers were lying like snow. I started to cry. I am walking around the room, crying, wailing: Vika's not here, what will come of her . . . Gaya, of course, was consoling me: "Mamma, nothing will happen to her, don't worry, calm down, she's in good company, they'll look out for her." Diana: I saw the green car burn. The car was burning when we went out onto the balcony. Gaya pushed me away, telling me to get off the balcony. I left. Then they came up to the balcony and asked if there were any Armenians here. -Zinaida: You're right, I forgot about that, that was on the 27th. Diana: There's a small, grassy area in front of our balcony; there are trees planted there. The mob asked if there were any Armenians in the building. All the neighbors said, no, there are no Armenians here. There weren't a lot of Armenians in our building, but there weren't just a few Armenian families, either. -Gayane: They fell upon the apartments on the 28th. There were terribly many of them. Our courtyard is huge, and it was completely filled with them. -Zinaida: Katusev had made an appearance on television earlier. He said that two people, Azerbaijanis, had been killed in Karabagh. And when he said that . . . you know how bees sound, have you heard how they buzz? It was like the buzzing of millions of bees . . . and with this buzzing they flew into our courtyard, howling and shouting. I don't know how to describe it. By this point we were afraid to watch from the balcony, but when I looked out of the bedroom window--the Znaniye Bookstore is down there, and Armenians live on the second and fourth floors--I saw their things being thrown out the windows. I realized that they would be upon us any minute. I shouted to Gayane, "Gaya, hide the gold." That's honestly what I told my child. I grabbed Diana. I didn't know what to do! Vika still wasn't home, and it was already getting dark. I was afraid to look at the time because I was already horrified as it was. -Gayane: Just in case, we changed the television channel from the Moscow station to the Azerbaijani one. -Zinaida: And turned it up loud. -Gayane: We never listened to Azerbaijani music. It just didn't do much for us. In all those years we almost never listened to it. But sometimes we would watch some entertainment show or film on Azerbaijani television. And that was it. And here we had it turned up full blast. So they would think we were Azerbaijanis. -Zinaida: Well you can imagine, they're slaughtering Armenians, robbing them, and we're listening to this concert music from Baku. Our Azerbaijani neighbors suggested we do it, they knocked on the door and told Gaya to turn on Azerbaijani music. But we already had it on anyway. Turn on the lights, they told us, so they will think you're not Armenians. They're saying the Armenians are afraid to turn on their lights, they're hiding. -Gayane: Apparently there was some kind of arrangement, because we noticed that the lights were off only in Armenian apartments, that is, the Azerbaijanis were warned, and every last one of them had their lights on. When we turned the lights off two of our neighbors came immediately, and later, another one. "Turn on the lights," they told us, "please. Nothing will happen. Be calm. Nothing will happen." -Zinaida: "We won't allow them to come into your apartment." -Gayane: We believed those people. We had never done anything bad to them. -Zinaida: After the whole nightmare, about March 15, before we left for Armenia, when I was coming into the building they were all crying. The Azerbaijanis were crying, saying, "Can it be there is no God? How could they raise their hands against your family? You never did anyone any harm, you never refused anyone anything, not in hard times, or in time of fortune, or in time of mourning. How could they give you away? How could they sell you down the river?" They really had given us away. Some of them protected us, but others gave us away. They sold us down the river. -Gayane: I was wearing slacks that day, and when it all began I became cautious for some reason and I changed my clothes. Azerbaijani women don't wear pants. Young Armenian and Russian girls in Sumgait wore pants, but the Azerbaijanis found that very strange. And I thought I better put on a skirt, otherwise they won't believe me if I told them we were Azerbaijanis. There was nothing else we could do. No other way out. I was forced to turn myself into God knows who. I let my hair down, tousled it, and threw a scarf over my head. -Zinaida: And she told me, "Mamma, you hide. Take Diana and go into the other room. You two look more like Armenians. They'll figure out that we're Armenians right away." But how could I go away and leave her there?! -Gayane: I went out onto the balcony. It worked out better that way. We were the only Armenian family in the fourth entryway. This gave us hope: we were the only ones, the neighbors wouldn't let them in. They, the Azerbaijanis, would fear for themselves and for their children. I looked and saw someone crawling up on the balcony from below, it was easy to get up onto our balcony. When we would lose the keys the neighbors would let up into their places and we would crawl across onto our balcony and get in that way. So I turned around and saw a guy with a knife on our balcony. He looks at me and shouts, "What nationality are you here?" -Zinaida: At the same time they were knocking on the door. -Gayane: "What nationality are you?" he's shouting. Well at first I was frightened, but then I got control of myself and answered in perfect Azerbaijani, "You should be ashamed of yourself, asking a question like that. Can't you see I'm an Azerbaijani? If I were an Armenian would I come out to meet you face to face and look you in the eyes?" He looks at me and tells the people with him, "Yes, Azerbaijanis live here." From below they tell him, "Check it out, it can't be, they have to be Armenians." And he asks me again, "What nationality are you?" I say, "Can't you see?" I started fuming. I could not say anything else. "You're blind, that's for sure! You can yell all you want, but that won't make us Armenians." I hear them breaking down our door, and Mamma went toward the door. I say, "I don't have time to deal with you, they're breaking down our door." 1 go to the door and ask, "Who is it?" They answer, "Open up!" I say, "Wait, why are you breaking the door? What's going on? I'm opening up." We never locked the lower lock, it was broken, but now they had locked it out of fear, and I couldn't get it open. I say wait, I'm looking for the key. I opened the door--it was almost broken down already. I opened the door and they burst in. I say, "What's going on? Why are you breaking down our door?" -Zinaida: Then they started climbing in from the balcony. They're shouting, "Why don't you open the door?" And I say, "Well you've already come in the balcony." Then Diana sees their knives, runs into the bathroom, and closes the door. Gaya cries out, "Mamma, Diana ran into the bathroom!" I ran to the door and forgot that we were pretending to be Azerbaijanis, and said in Armenian: "Diana, open the door!" Gaya tried to calm them down, and I'm shouting with tears in my eyes for Diana to open the door. -Diana I was sitting on the couch with my doll, Little Red Riding Hood. That guy climbed in from the balcony with a big knife with a yellow handle. They put it up to Mamma's stomach. I ran to the bathroom, opened the door, and slammed it behind me. I was frightened, and started to cry. I shouted, "Mamma, they want to kill you!" And then . . . then they started shouting, "Give us your passports." And Gaya says, "What do you need passports for, we're Azerbaijanis." -Gayane: I tried to convince them that we were Azerbaijanis, I was trying everything I could, I could get on my knees and plead. I could humble myself, because at that moment I was worried about other lives than just my own. To be honest I didn't care about anything else, as long as my little sister would survive, her life and health had cost us so dearly! I tell them, "What, don't you understand anything?" They started shouting, they were tremendously excited, shouting with terribly loud voices, saying that in Stepanakert their girls were being killed, raped, and tossed around with pitchforks. Why shouldn't they do the same to us? I said, "Who's doing all that? Who is doing it? Some Armenians! What does that have to do with us? Give me the knife, I'll cut my own face." "Now you calm down," they tell me. Zinaida: I told them, "Why didn't you deal with them there! There, in Karabakh? Nothing has happened here, no one has been fighting here, not we with the Armenians, nor they with us. Why didn't you give it right back to them there? What've we got to do with this?" I got confused. I had been saying that we were Azerbaijanis, but suddenly I started speaking as though I were an Armenian, but they didn't notice. One of them was next to me, with a knife at my breast. And he says to the others, "What pretty girls." He meant Gaya and my 10-year-old Diana. I was terrified. Gaya started assuring them that we were Azerbaijanis. One guy stood in the doorway and gave us bad looks. -Gayane: He demanded the passports. I said, "Young man, I don't have my passport here." He says, "Let's have the passport, we won't believe you without your passport." And one of them started hurriedly searching for documents. They turned the wardrobe in the other room upside down, took the picture off the wall, and started pulling the clothes off their hooks, yelling and shouting, "Passport! Passport!" They all started yelling, there was so much noise in the apartment. They were all shouting. My hair stood on end. Suddenly I said, "Listen, my Papa died, 40 days haven't passed yet, we have a Muslim household, we're in mourning, you should be ashamed of yourselves, you've disgraced your honor." And then Mamma started to cry. -Zinaida: I started crying: "My husband died, 40 days haven't yet passed, aren't you ashamed of yourselves!" In fact my husband had died seven years earlier, in 1981. "We're in mourning, and you burst in here demanding docu- ments. The documents are at the housing office, I'm filing for my pension." Well it seemed like they believed us. Then one guy said, "They're Lezgins. Can't you see, there are no men here, only women. Leave." Another fellow in the group agreed with him, he also said that we were Lezgins. But a third said, "No, they're Armenians." Well the other two convinced him, I don t know how, and all the rest of them listened to them too. There were about 50 of them, if not more, all in our three-room apartment, even the entryway was filled. They started leaving. Yes, we're Lezgins, we're Lezgins." They started leaving, and one of them took our tape recorder with him. And the one who had first called us Lezgins says, "Leave that, what are you doing?" They seemed to obey that guy. -Gayane: He was tall, wearing baggy jeans and a coat. -Zinaida: With a little moustache, I think. -Gayane: No, he didn't have a moustache, he was tall with brown hair, he wasn't a bad-looking sort. He didn't have anything in his hands. -Zinaida: He stood at the threshold. -Gayane: Yes, he didn't look like a bad guy, and you know, his face seemed familiar to me. I had seen him somewhere. And more than once. But I can't remember where. When he came in I was stupefied, I had a premonition that he wouldn't be able to remain indifferent. When he said that we were Lezgins and that they should leave, such gladness started to glow inside of me. Hope. They continued to argue on their way out. Some said, "They're Armenians all the same." And that fellow answered, "even if they are Armenians, it's shameful, the father died, they're mourning, there's nothing but women in the house, there's no men. We should stay out of the apartment." "What do you mean, stay out? We can go in there!" And he said, "No, we should stay out, they're Lezgins, we're leaving here." The three of them protected us. -Zinaida: No, the two of them. The one in the short coat and the one in the grey suit, who stood at the threshold, about 19 or 20 years old. Well they were all young really. The two of them defended us. -Diana: Three, three! -Zinaida: Do you remember the third one, Diana? -Diana: Yes, he was wearing dark clothes. -Gayane: The third one was the one who came back. He wore a long brown coat. -Diana: He wore a long, darkish brown coat, and his hair was dark too. When they left, they told him downstairs that those women were Armenians, and ran back and said that they were going to kill us. -Zinaida: They had all left, and we had started to calm down a little, and I closed the door. And then there is a knock. I told Gaya, "Take Diana and go into the other room." My daughters went into the dining room, and I opened the door. There was a guy there who said, "Run, hide! They're coming to kill you now!" We ran up to the third floor. We had some good neighbors up there, Azerbaijanis. I sent the kids and stood there alone, not knowing what to do. I was so far gone . . . Out of a whole room I couldn't even think of anything to take. I even forgot to take my work documents; at the time I had been preparing a report to send to Baku, and the documents were at home. I couldn't see anything . . . I could only see Vika, my older daughter. I sent Gaya and Diana upstairs, and stood there asking that fellow, "Should I close the door and leave everything like this?" He says, "What do you mean, door? Get out of here, they're coming to kill you! What are you standing there for?" And I ran after the children. -Gayane: We barely had time to get up to the third floor when they burst into our apartment and started shouting, "Where are the Armenians?" We were already at the neighbors'. They had an infant at the time, and the neighbor said, "Don't you worry, I'm not letting anyone in this apartment no matter what." -Zinaida: On the third floor there I started asking the folks, our neighbors, to go meet Vika. The bus was due to arrive at eight o'clock. I dissolved in tears, Gaya was soothing me, Diana was next to us, she was crying too, and I'm already thinking that I've lost my older daughter, but deep in my heart I still believe she's alive . . . And my tears choked me. I was going out of my mind. But no one could leave the building, the courtyard was packed with people, swarming with them. From the balcony the neighbor in whose apartment we were hiding asked the bandits, "Where are those Armenians, the ones who were at home? Where did they make off to?" They told him they didn't know. They asked him where he lived. He answered, "Can't you see, on the third floor." He asked them specially to divert attention from his own apartment. We heard them taking free reign of our apartment, and they threw our color television off the balcony and it exploded. -Gayane: Mamma was crying the whole time. She fell into a faint and we brought her around and held her back, because the whole time she kept making for the door to go outside, alternately raving and sobbing, shouting, and calling Vika. She didn't notice us, probably because we were next to her. Her thoughts were only on Vika. The neighbors who were hiding us were calming her too, offering tea. -Zinaida: We are very grateful to them. Thanks to them my children and I are alive, well, and unharmed. When they were throwing our belongings out and burning them--the beds, the pillows, and the chairs--our neighbor came to us and said, "How lucky you are that it's not you standing there naked, but some other woman instead. You're from our part of the building you lost your husband, you have children, thank God you're not in her position, we wouldn't have been able to take it. I don't know what I would do." He of course wouldn't have done anything, he was just trying to calm us down. In the yard they were torturing our neighbors, fellow Armenians They lived on the fifth floor, in the third entryway. A married couple, Vanya and Nina, and their three children. Their last name is V. They hid their two daughters, and stayed with their son to defend themselves, they even got boiling water ready, and an axe, and held them off for a long time, but the . . . They beat up the husband, dragged the wife outside, and stood her naked next to our burning things; her husband was lying at her feet on the ground. The crowd shouted, "Look at the naked Armenian!" They were going to throw the poor woman into the fire. The neighbors came out, an Azerbaijani woman threw her a scarf, and she covered herself with it, and the neighbors led her off to their apartment. All the neighbors saw and heard it . . . -Gayane: Mamma wouldn't allow it but I went to the window and saw her standing there, and they took skewers that had been heated in the fire and stuck them into her body. Our neighbor, who lived in the same entryway as Nina--she lives with us in the same boarding house now--saw what they had done, Nina showed her, from her knees up, almost up to her neck, her whole body was covered, riddled, with wounds. -Zinaida: In the morning, during the night of the 29th, rather, after one o'clock, two buses approached the station. I wanted to run out. By then I didn't care any more if I lived or died, but Gayane wouldn't let me go, and the neighbors said that I would bring disaster to them and they would be slain along with their children. Gaya was crying and said that I forgot about them, my other children, but I could only think of Vika. I imagined her torn to pieces, I'm a mother, and they're just children, they don't understand I would have jumped off the balcony and run to the soldiers for help. I was going to do it but Gayane wouldn't let me: "Mamma, please! Mamma, I beg of you!" The neighbors were sleeping and Gayane woke them with her cries. So we held on that way till morning. On the morning of the 29th I told our neighbor I was going to go downstairs to our apartment, maybe Vika was lying there, murdered. He told me he would go himself. He was gone for about five minutes, but it seemed like an eternity to me. He returned and said there was no one there, nothing. I went down too, stole down like a mouse, and slipped in everything was thrown all about. I didn't go to the soldiers because the armored personnel carriers were far away, farther than the bus station. I began looking for the briefcase with my work in it. I was miserable because of my daughter, and at the same time because of my work. My documents were there, my travel papers--I worked in the transport division -- and my trip sheets. -Gayane: Mamma is a very responsible person, she was always ready to work around the clock to do her job. -Zinaida: I look around and I can't find the briefcase. I didn't care about the fact that everything had been stolen out of all three of my rooms, that everything was smashed, and the furniture was broken, I worried about that later, but at first I was concerned about the lost documents. I went into the kitchen. My daughter had hidden some valuables in the gas stove: my ring and my earrings. It was all there. Five minutes passed and Gayane ran in and said, "Mamma, hurry." And Diana came downstairs too. Gayane found her coat among the debris, and Diana found her track shoes, her coat, and some of her dresses. -Diana: Immediately after we got back up to the neighbors they started throwing things around in the apartment under us. They threw a television onto the asphalt, it exploded so violently it sounded like a thunderclap. Then, when Vika wasn't there, I wouldn't eat, and they forced me, but I couldn't eat. Because I loved Vika terribly and she and I had always gone to the movies and gone for walks in the park. When we went into our apartment the next day and everything was broken, right away I started looking for my dolls and my books, but I didn't see anything. When we went back upstairs I managed to take two cups from my tea service, and Gaya took Vika's suit and one of her own dresses. My Italian boots were gone, my brown coat, it was beautiful, there wasn't a one of my beautiful dolls, and my giant lion was gone too, the one that had been on top of the television. He was very large and very handsome. I had two satchels, one for first grade and the other for second grade, one was yellow-green with a boy and a girl on it, they're playing a drum and a violin, and there is a dog sitting there closing its ears, and on the other one were the letters A, B, C, D, E and the numbers 4+5, two girls and a boy with their mouths open like they are singing. They were beautiful satchels. They were gone too. I had many books, I collected them, they were in the bedside tables. And a boy had given me a little apron and a headband for my birthday, they weren't around either. And I had some big books, fat ones, and they disappeared, only one was left, The Malachite Box. The Adventures of Karlson, Pippi Longstockings, and Fairy Tales of the World were left. All the other books were gone. -Zinaida: I continued searching for my briefcase, and then my supervisor arrived. He had waited for me until nine o'clock, but I didn't appear, and he thought something must have happened, so he came. He's a Russian, Aleksei Semyonovich Lomakin. Alik Aliyev, the mechanic, came with him. When they saw my wrecked apartment they were just petrified, they could not say a thing. When I saw them I started crying. My Azerbaijani neighbors came in. Some of them were crying, others were helping me pick up. I go on looking for my documents and at the same time put things into the wardrobe. Now that I remember it it's both funny and painful: How could I have thought that I had returned to my apartment and that everything had gone back to normal? Incidentally, later, when I went back to the apartment again those things were gone too. And the door was gone. After my supervisor left, in the afternoon, the neighbor said that we should leave, find another refuge. "I'm afraid," he said, "that someone saw you come to my apartment, and that they could kill you and us too. My God, where could I go it was daytime and those . . . I don't even know what to call them, the bandits, those marauders, those jackals, I don't know what to call them, I can't find the words, they were everywhere. Where should I go with two girls? When I opened the door I had tears in my eyes, and I was terrified . . . And he said, "Go to Alik's, he's an Azerbaijani, too." and I say, "You should have said that earlier, when my supervisor was here with the car, he could have taken us with him." Everyone feared for their own lives. What could I do? I went out into the entryway and stood. And he says, "any other time I would keep you here a year, or two. But right now, I'm sorry . . . " Then another door opened, also on the third floor. I ask the neighbor, "Tayara, can we hide at your place?" She's an Azerbaijani too. She says, "What kind of question is that? Come in!" She hid us. There were many people in the courtyard, and Gaya and I hid in the wardrobe, and they put Diana under a mattress, leaving a small opening so the child could breathe. Tayara said that when the bandits left she would let us out, and when they came back she would hide us again. We sat in the wardrobe for about a half hour. Gaya became ill, and I allowed her to get out. My legs fell asleep and felt like cannons. We hadn't eaten or drunk anything for so long, since the 27th, when we saw that horror--and all of it just snapped in me. Tayara's husband went outside, even though I begged him to stay, saying there should be a man in the house. He said that he'd be in the courtyard, and if anything happened his wife would signal him. She put her passport and all of their documents on the table so if they suddenly came in she could show them that they were an Azerbaijani family. My girls went to the window--and what was going on out there! I feared for my children, that someone would recognize them from the street. Gaya let her hair down and put on a scarf so she would resemble an Azerbaijani, but directly across there was a 9-story building, their windows were right across from us, and I shouted that someone would see her and give us away on the spot. But she kept on looking. -Diana: I watched too. -Zinaida: Downstairs the bandits were fighting with the soldiers. The soldiers didn't shoot, they didn't have orders to. I saw them throwing rocks at the soldiers, they were young boys, 18- and 19-year olds, and they defended themselves . . . I'm a mother after all, and they were no different from my children. When one of the soldiers fell and his head started bleeding I had to stop looking, l couldn't watch anymore . . . I imagined my children in their shoes . . . -Gayane: The troops had assumed their defense that morning and had cordoned off the buildings, and some of the soldiers surrounded the bus station, Block 36, and our Microdistrict 3. But they only cordoned them off from the outside. The mob fell upon the soldiers, who started to protect themselves, and the mob surged into the courtyard with the soldiers after it. They caught several Azerbaijanis and started beating them with their clubs. One fell down and they cracked open another's head . . . -Zinaida: They show Lebanon on television, and the war in Afghanistan--that's just what it was like. Like in America, how they attack demonstrations with shields and clubs--that's just how it was in our courtyard. -Gayane: Don't compare it with America, those were peaceful demonstrations, but these?! -Zinaida: But how could it happen here and not off somewhere in America! They attacked the soldiers, hurled stones at them . . . Then I thought, where's the tear gas that the Americans use to disperse demonstrators? If they had used gas on those jackals they all would have scattered. -Gayane: They would not have scattered. The soldiers had been there since morning, they didn't bring in fresh troops. They hadn't eaten, they were fine standing there for about three hours, but then they got tired. They weren't even allowed to sit down . . . At noon they, the soldiers, attacked them, and then the tables were turned. The mob went after the soldiers, the guys were bunched into a group in the center street and covered themselves with their shields, and the Azerbaijanis surrounded them and threw paving stones at them. And those guys sat there covering themselves with their shields. And meanwhile tanks with machine guns were cruising the streets . . . They always say, "Our children have never seen war." I never even dreamed about it, there was no need to. But then I thought about those people who had lived through a war. It was truly horrible . . . The guys were tired, exhausted, some had had their clubs taken away, others, their shields, they had been beaten, they were covered in blood . . . so many died! They beat the soldiers with their own clubs and shields. And those guys stood there and couldn't defend themselves, they couldn't open fire. They couldn't even defend themselves, let alone us. It's comical . . . -Zinaida: What are you saying? How can it be funny? -Gayane: No, I didn't mean that: How could something like that happen during our Soviet period? It's painfully embarrassing! And they burned the armored personnel carriers, too. Someone shouted, "Get away, it's going to blow!" Everyone scattered away, and the armored personnel carrier exploded. The soldiers lost their senses. And when they drove the personnel carrier and the bus at the mob out of rage and fury, they drove right up on the sidewalk. -Zinaida: The bus that had brought the troops. Only the driver was in it. The bus ran over three people straight off, I saw it. And two armored personnel carriers ran over four more. All in one or two minutes. The bus ran over three, one of the carriers ran over two, and the second, two more. Right on our street there's a dry cleaners and appliance and watch repair places; one of the armored personnel carriers went that way, and they say it ran over several over there, too. But they ran over seven before our eyes. Then the bus ploughed into a book kiosk. -Gayane: No, that was a flower place. It was a new booth. He drove straight into it. -Zinaida: The driver jumped out and they dragged the vehicle out to the middle of the road and set it on fire. -Gayane: And I also saw the troops put a bunch of Azerbaijanis in a bus and take them in a convoy to Baku. There were many arrests. -Zinaida: Our neighbor, the one who hid us, couldn't take it, and he told his wife that we should leave. They were running around in the courtyard looking for the Armenians. They knew that they were hiding with Azerbaijanis, and they were saying that they were going to check the Azerbaijani families. Poor Tayara got scared too, and started to cry; I pleaded with her, I said that I would remember forever how she saved my children and me, but where could we go? -Gayane: She didn't make us leave, she said that she would do anything, but she was afraid. -Zinaida: I told Tayara that we would just stay a little longer and that at night we would return to our apartment. Then her husband came back and said that a curfew had been imposed. He says, "Zina, you owe us a drink. Gorbachev announced a curfew." And Bagirov [First Secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] was on television, he said that two people had been killed in Karabagh, but nothing was wrong, automobile windows had been broken, but there hadn't been any killings. He kept making statements, and there were Azerbaijani songs and dances. Tayara turned the TV all the way up. When we learned of the curfew we calmed down, but then a crowd ran into the courtyard again, a large one. Our neighbor told them that there had been only one Armenian family here, but they had already killed them all, there was no one left. We hid in the wardrobe again. and they stuck Diana back under the bed. -Gayane: Tayara went down to our apartment to see what was happened there, and found two bandits. They asked her, "What are you doing here" Tayara answered, "I came to take something for myself." "Take all you want, they're gone now." -Zinaida: Yes, she had wanted to get something for us, at least some bedding. She said, "What are you going to do, empty handed, naked, with three children, nothing remains of your entire apartment." In short, we calmed down, and the crowd raced off to the other building, the one across from us. I don't know what went on there. -Gayane: The curfew had its effect on the gangs, many started to disperse: they were warned that they would open fire on them. The soldiers didn't know the city, they couldn't get oriented, they drove up and down the main streets, but didn't go into the courtyards. When we were at the City Party Committee they asked people from Sumgait to go with them and show them the way. -Zinaida: The tanks entered the city on the night of the 29th. -Gayane: No, Mamma, the tanks had been there earlier, but were near the City Party Committee, where the Armenians were . . . After midnight, on March 1, when I had finally gotten to sleep after two sleepless nights, Mamma said, "Get your things together, they have sent buses for us." As it was we had been dressed the entire time. Mamma went to check it out . . .and came back for us. -Zinaida: When I came back for the children Tayara said that Vika was alive and well, some guys had come and told her that they had hidden her in a safe place. I both believed it and didn't believe it. We ran out to the tanks. The Gambarians were there, Roman and Sasha; their father, Shurik, the clarinetist, was killed, and their mother was there. Sasha came over and asked about the girls. I was surprised, how did he know my girls? He said that he knew me and the girls. Our neighbor himself went for Gaya and Diana and it seemed like he was taking forever so I went after him. Another neighbor came out, Anna Vasilyevna, a Russian: "Zinochka, my dear, goodbye and good luck." She kissed Diana. They put us in the bus and the captain gave the order for us to be taken to the City Party Committee. The bus wouldn't start, so they put us on another one. It was pouring rain. -Diana: When they imposed the curfew there were many soldiers on the streets, and they all had clubs and shields. And when the Azerbaijanis attacked them, many of the soldiers died. They threw paving stones--huge rocks--at the soldiers. I saw this myself. The soldiers ran over those Azerbaijanis with the tanks. The soldiers saw that the Azerbaijanis were doing violence to people and they ran over them out of rage. We got scared and they hid me under a mattress and a blanket, and Gaya and Mamma crawled into the wardrobe. And they were fighting right down there on the street . . . Near the building they were blowing up buses and tanks, and cars were burning, and there were many dead in the courtyard. They drove without looking to see if it was a sidewalk or a street, they just drove, and the ones who didn't manage to get out of the way were run over by the tanks. And when we left--it was evening, it was already dark--there were three buses, and one of them had soldiers in it. Mamma ran up and said, "Get your clothes on, let's go." Gaya was wearing slippers, and I had on my blue dress, but it was an old one. I was wearing my old jacket, my old dress, and slippers. And nothing else. Gaya had on a skirt, her Angora sweater, and slippers. It was raining hard, and there were puddles on the street. They gave Mamma an old coat because she was wearing a short-sleeved dress; she put it on and we ran out. We got onto the bus and I was hungry, one of the soldiers from Yerevan gave me rations and carried me from one bus to the other in his arms. I gave him the little glass that remained from Vika's trousseau, and he gave me his telephone number. -Gayane: In the bus there was a soldier with a shield sitting at every window. We had to be ready for anything. They took us to the City Party Committee, let us out, and then took us into the City Party Committee building under armed guard. It was jammed with people and you couldn't breathe. We asked, "Are these all us? Armenians?" They answered yes. We were surprised that there were so many Armenians in Sumgait. All those years we lived there and didn't know there were so many Armenians, 18,000. We were struck by that, we had never noticed. Going downstairs the next day I ran into the Secretary of the Komsomol from Vika's plant, the Khimprom. He said that Vika was alive and well. When I told Mamma she of course calmed down some more. But you know, after all that it was hard to believe anything, our faith in everything was just gone. She didn't believe it completely. -Zinaida: I didn't believe it because I had heard all kinds of things. When we arrived at the City Party Committee we heard everything imaginable! It was the fear of God. I saw many of our acquaintances, they were kissing each other and asking how their children and homes were. Many people already knew that there had been a pogrom of our apartment. They had seen the broken windows. I cried, saying that I didn't know where Vika was. One woman said that they had taken two of her daughters and that she couldn't find one of them; the other had been slashed all over. A second said that her husband and her son had been murdered. That was Nelli Aramian. She lived in Building 6 in our microdistrict. They killed her husband, Armo, and her son Artur. I heard so many things like that that I was already starting to lose touch; my patience had run dry waiting for my daughter. Later an Azerbaijani fellow came to me and said, Aunt Zina, Vika sent me, she's alive and well and hidden in a safe place; if you want I'll call her there and you can speak with her. We went downstairs to the first floor and he called Vika. I spoke with her, heard the voice of my child. She had managed to survive in that hell. Then I started begging that Azerbaijani to bring her to the City Party Committee. He tried to talk me out of it: "I'll bring her wherever you go, don't worry, I've looked after her better than a brother does a sister." All the same I asked him to get her. He brought her and I calmed down. On the second day there was a meeting with Demichev [Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR,] and people started shouting. One shouted, "Give me my son back!", another yelled, "Where is my daughter?!", a third wanted her husband . . . Bagirov was there too, and he stood there blinking, not saying anything. -Gayane: When Demichev asked where we wanted to go, everyone shouted, "To Russia!" To be honest we were all frightened of Armenia, there were such wild rumors it was as though we were in a terrible dream, and no one wanted to go to Armenia. But he said that he couldn't evacuate 18,000 people to Russia and that he would meet with everyone individually the next day and speak with them. And he also said that today he was going to go look at all of our apartments. On March 3 we went to the military barracks in the village of Nasosny. We were taken care of marvelously by the military. They sent special flights of children right from there to Minvody, Yerevan, and Moscow. One woman left for Moscow with a letter for Gorbachev and Gromyko. -Zinaida: The worst was truly behind us by then. Everything had passed, but the pain will remain for our whole lives. It cannot be forgotten. Under no circumstances should we, our children, or our grandchildren forget. Who will answer for those who died? For our mothers, sisters, brother, sons and daughters? Who will bear the responsibility? Who will wash away their blood? Someone should be made to answer, and severely, so it has an effect on the people that did with us as they pleased . . . It isn't over yet, now we live here, in Armenia, protected, but the issue isn't resolved. We would like to stay in Armenia, in our homeland, so that all the Armenian people will be united. Then we will be invincible. Armenians won't be scattered throughout the Soviet Union, about the world, and if we're all together this won't happen again. As a mother of three children, as a woman, as a sister, I ask Armenians to be united so that what happened in Sumgait will never happen again. Our homeland . . . The only request we have is that we be helped in obtaining an apartment and getting jobs. So that our children can work for the good of Armenia. If we aren't able to, then let our children do it. And if it's possible, we'll work for the good of Armenia too. This is the land of our forefathers. Our grandfathers and great-grandfathers lived here too, it was only later that people dispersed all over. Like a mother, the land here bore and reared us. It is our wife, and will protect us, too. I want but one thing: that our people never see the hardship that our children saw, that your children here, in Armenia, never see anything like it.

The treaty on the exchange of the Turkish and Greek minorities (1923) left no Greek minority in Turkiye, except a few thousand Greeks in istanbul. Turkiye is no longer an obstacle for 'Pan-Hellenism.' Although the material basis of Greek policy is no longer visible, there is a residue, which seems to unite the Pelopenisians, the Greeks who came from Asia Minor, the Greeks who are originally from the islands of the Marmara Sea or those who live in the numerous Aegean islands. This residue is also recognizable in the contemporary Greek government. >As far a Greek Turkish wars are conserned I find it funny that a >so informed Turk like you forgot to mention the Balkan wars 1912-1923. Not a chance. Greece lost in each and every war conducted "solely" between Greece and Turkiye: in the Morea in 1821, in Thessaly in 1897-98, and in Anatolia in 1922. After the Ottoman Empire lost World War I, the British landed in 1919 a 200,000 Greek army in Izmir to exterminate the people of Turkiye. Are you suffering from a severe case of amnesia? The tired and defeated Turks rose up, formed a National Force under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal, and on August 30, 1922 they annihilated the bulk of the Greek Army. >> Turkiye >> is no longer an obstacle for 'Pan-Hellenism.'

Greek Efforts to Decimate the Jewish Population of Salonica Culminated in 1912 and 1913 <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to the great port of Izmir. Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912 and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War, when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>> <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923 which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the occupation of Greece starting in 1941. Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence. Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as 800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876- 1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states, with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the Empire.>> [47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92; Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2, 12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek children in the streets of Salonica.

Now you expect that turks living in Greece should be treated like So, the Greek educational system is also in a shambles. History shows that within the last 170 years, Greeks played that game twice: They used Istanbul Patriarch Grigorios in 1822 to instigate the Morea rebellion that resulted in the massacres of the Muslim people. Again, the Orthodox Patriarch Constantine V invited the Russian Czar Nicholas II to invade the Ottoman Empire 'in the name of Jesus,' and save his flock from Ottoman rule. Source: "The 'Past' in Medieval and Modern Greek Culture," in Speros Vryonis, ed., 'Byzantina kai Metabyzantina,' Vol I (Malibu, Calif., 1978). p. 161. In the words of Professor Skiotis, "With savage jubilance, [the Greeks] sang the words 'Let no Turk remain in the Morea, nor in the whole world.' The Greeks were determined to achieve to 'Romaiko' in the only way they knew how: through a war of religious extermination." Let me further improve this one for you. After the Ottoman Empire lost World War I, the British landed in 1919 a 200,000 Greek army in Izmir to exterminate the people of Turkiye. Are you suffering from a severe case of amnesia? The tired and defeated Turks rose up, formed a National Force under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal, and on August 30, 1922 they annihilated the bulk of the Greek Army. Now wait, there is more. <<The Greek War of Independence brought disaster to the Jewish communities in the Peloponnesos, where the revolution erupted in 1821. The Jews, because of their close association with the Ottoman administration, were massacred along with the Turks. The Jewish communities of Mistras, Tripolis, and Kalamata were decimated; the few survivors moved north to settle in Chalkis and Volos, still under Ottoman rule. Patras lost its ancient Jewish community, which was refounded only in 1905.>> Nikos Stavroulakis 'Athens-Auschwitz', page ix. Source: Professor Stanford J. Shaw, 'The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic,' New York University Press, New York (1991). page 187: <<...the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire which had been going on for a century was disastrous for Ottoman Jewry. This was the age of nationalism among the Christian subjects of the Sultan, starting with the Greek Revolution early in the nineteenth century, which, based on the Megali Idea, or Great Idea, sought to add to Greek kingdom Istanbul and large portions of Anatolia, union of which with Greece was felt to be the 'dream and hope of all'. The success of the Greek national movement, provided more in fact by the intervention of the Great Powers than by the efforts of the Greeks themselves, stimulated similar uprisings among the other subjects in Southeastern Europe who had long been oppressed, not so much by the Ottomans but, rather, by the Greek religious hierarchy which dominated the Orthodox millet, leading first to pressure for religious independence, granted to the Bulgarian Orthodox Exarchate in 1870, to the Serbian Church in 1879, and to the Rumanian Church in 1885, with subsequent aspirations for, and achievement of, political independence following...>> page 188: <<...They [new nationalist leaders] were greatly assisted in their campaigns against the Ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular representatives of the major Powers of Europe and also by Christian missionaries, who emphasized feelings of Christian superiority and hatred for Muslims and Jews which fortified the religious as well as ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence. Christian nationalism, based as much on religious as on ethnic identity, soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both Jews and Muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past. Vicious anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic movements developed, involving large-scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies, by the independent states that resulted, also by Christian subjects who remained within the Empire, particularly because of Jewish and Muslim support for Ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent nationalist states of Southeastern Europe. The results were explosive and damaging. The invading armies of Russia and Austria as well as the revolting nationalists and, later, successfully established independent Christian states, committed systematic genocide against Jews and Muslims throughout the nineteenth century, despite Great Power admonitions to the contrary in the treaties of Paris (1858) and Berlin (1878),...>> page 188: <<...As the peoples of Southeastern Europe achieved their independence, their Muslim and Jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and massacred, and those who survived were driven beyond the ever-shrinking boundaries of the retreating Ottoman Empire in a kind of slaughter which had not been seen since the dispersal of the Jews from Palestine centuries earlier. This sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth century, with the Rumanian Principalities taking the lead, as united Rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth century. In 1579 the ruler of Moldavia, Peter the Lame, banished its Jews because of their competition with its Christian merchants. When Prince Micheal the Brave revolted against the Ottomans in the Rumanian principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia in 1593, he ordered the massacre of all the Jews as well as Turks in Bucharest.>> page 189: <<The slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century. When the Greeks revolted against Ottoman rule many Greek volunteers coming from Russia and the Principalities to join in the effort slaughtered and plundered the Jewish communities along their paths as they went through Moldavia and Wallachia toward Greece.>> page 190 (second paragraph): <<When Venice occupied the island of Chios in 1694, its Jewish population was either massacred or deported and all Jewish communal and personal property was stolen by the native Greek population, leaving those Jews who returned in utter poverty and reduced to begging, no longer able to compete with the Greeks in trade or commerce.>> page 190 (third paragraph): <<Jews living in Greece and the Rumanian principalities suffered terribly because of their support for Ottoman rule. When the Greek nationalist movement Philike Etairia started its uprising in Wallachia and Moldavia during the spring of 1821, hundreds of Jews and Muslims were killed by the Greeks who lived there as well as by native Wallachs [14]. During the height of the Greek revolution, five thousand Jews were massacred in Morea along with most of the Muslim population, numbering about twenty thousand in all [15]. In Tripolizza alone 1,200 Jews were massacred along with uncounted Turks [16]. Reverend John Hartley, after describing the carnage, concluded 'Thus did Jewish blood, mingled with Turkish, flow down the streets of captured city. The sons of Isaac and the sons of Ishmael, on this as well as on every occasion during the Greek Revolution, met with common fate. Their corpses were cast out of the city, and, like the ancient sovereign of Judah, they received no burial superior to that of an ass.' [17] Jewish communities on the islands of Sparta, Patras, Corinthos, Mistra, and Argos were wiped out by bands of Greek rebels along with those of Thebes, Vrachori, Attica and Epirus [18]. The surviving Jews fled to the island of Corfu, where Jews who had fled from Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity under the Venetian rule since the twelfth century, though divided into rival Greek and Italian communities. It was not long, however, before it too fell victim to the Greek Revolution, leading to savage repression and massacres of Jews, forcing the surviving members of the two communities to come together for self-defense for the first time. Throughout the years of Greek revolution, Greek nationalists went from town to town on the mainland and from island to island in the Agean, exterminating all the Jews and Muslims they could find, many along the roads as they desperately fled to safety in what was left of the Ottoman Empire. Contemporary accounts relate that the Greeks left the murdered Jews and Muslims lying exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards [19]. Most of the Jews who survived these massacres fled across the Agean in small boats to Izmir, thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of Ottoman Jewish life during the nineteenth century. Only in Northern Greece, particularly in the areas of Janina and Salonica, were the Jews and the Turks able to successfully resist the Greek assaults, thus saving their populations from massacre as well [20]. During the remainder of the 19th century, particularly during the Greek-Turkish war in 1897, those Jews who remained in Greece in the areas of Athens, Chalkis, Larissa, Corfu and Crete suffered severe persecution and massacre, forcing thousands more to emigrate into Ottoman territory, particularly to Salonica and Izmir [21].>> page 193 (last paragraph): <<The inclusion in the Treaty of Berlin of stipulations providing protection for the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Southeastern Europe stimulated more popular anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hysteria in all the countries involved, with blood-libel accusations once again being used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging Jewish quarters as well as for new tactics for boycotting Jewish shopkeepers, merchants and professionals, a movement which was quickly adapted by the Christian millets in the major cities of the Ottoman Empire. Because the Bulgarians, Rumanians and Greeks correctly regarded the Jews as supporters of the Turks, both Jews and Turks were expelled from these countries in equally atrocious and brutal manners. Their property was plundered and their homes and shops taken over without compensation, while the survivors fled in desperation to Edirne and Istanbul. While official statements subsequently were issued granting equal rights to Jews, little was done in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the twentieth century.>> page 194 (last paragraph): <<Things were not much better elsewhere in Southeastern Europe or the Greek islands of the Agean and the eastern Mediterranean. In 1891 the Jews on Corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local Greeks due to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations [26]. Many of those who survived found refuge in Ottoman territory with the help of a popular subscription drive carried out in Istanbul under leadership of the Banque Camondo. In 1881 and 1884, and again in 1892 and 1903, thousands of Jews came to Ottoman territory as a result of pogroms in Russia which went on between 1881 and 1921 with only slight periods of respite. In 1899 Jewish families arrived in Istanbul in flight from persecution in Vidin, in independent Bulgaria. The conquest of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia by Greek and Bulgarian forces during the Balkan Wars (1912-13), including Salonica, Corlu, and Edirne, was followed by general attacks on Jews, their synagogues, homes and shops, in both countries [27], resulting in a renewed exodus toward Istanbul and beyond. Two reports from Salonica graphically described the situation caused by the invading armies: 'All the self-interested justifications of the newspapers of Europe, all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth, can never destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the entry of the Greeks in Salonica. A week of terror and horror one can never easily forget. The Hellenes now cruelly feel today all the damage that the explosion of hatred by the (Greek) population has done to their cause. The mob has shown itself odious and the government weak...The incompetence of the Greek administration and the horrors inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation. The consuls guaranteed the absolute safety of the Muslims, but sixty of them were massacred in a single night....'[28] 'It wasn't only irregulars (Comitacis) who massacred, pillaged and burned. The soldiers of the Army, the Chief of Police, and the high civil officials took an active part in the events at Serres. Out of 6,000 houses, 4,000 were burned. Almost 1,200 shops were consumed by flames and destructive bombs. The (Jewish) population lost all, and without even anything to wear is in despair. Everyone wants to emigrate...'[29] page 196: <<As a result of these assaults, massacres, and forced deportations from the independent countries of Southeastern Europe, the Ottoman Empire received literally thousands of Jewish refugees who joined the Muslims who survived the persecution, flooding into the Empire...>> [14] Shlomo Rozanes, Korot Hayehudim Beturkiyah Vebeartzot Hakedem: Hadorot Haachronim (Jerusalem, 1945), pp.42-44, cited Yitzchak Kerem, 'The Influence of Anti-Semitism on Jewish Immigration Patterns from Greece to the Ottoman Empire in the 19th Century', pp.2, 14.

What is your proof that they "did the best they could"? Unless they had strong evidence that the children were in IMMEDIATE danger then "the best they could" have done was to SHOW RESTRAINT. Some of us DID predict this outcome, or at least suggested a strong possibility of it. I, for one, said that in the event of an assault against the building the CHILDREN were the ones in danger either from the assault itself or from a "Jonestown" (my phrase a week after the seige started) style suicide. And as I pointed out then, and repeatedly over the objections of people on the net who disagreed with me, an adult may freely choose suicide but they have no right to impose this choice on their children. Now, while I don't expect the FBI to pay any attention to what I have to say on this, I *DO* expect them to figure it out on their own or to take the advice of experts. The cult specialist inter- viewed in yesterday's Boston Globe said he was repeatedly "stonewalled" by the FBI when he pointed out to them that their confrontational tactics played perfectly into Koresh's mad view of the world and so increased the chance of a tragic outcome. >Some responses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were >done without regard for the lives of the people in the compound - give >me a break. Give *US* a break! Pumping teargas for 45 minutes into a compound filled with CHILDREN?!! This doesn't seem to show much regard for their lives or safety. "Nontoxic teargas" is an oxymoron. Children have tiny respiratory passages which are easily blocked by the secretions induced by teargas; moreover teargas can easily cause fatalities in anyone subject to laryngospasms, asthma, or heart disease. If a madman is holding a gun to a hostage, someone who provokes the madman by attacking him bears nearly as much repsonsibility for the death of the hostage as the madman himself. These kinds of situations have to be handled *delicately* - not by surrounding a place with tanks and heavily armed personnel and blaring rock music from loud- speakers at all hours. That approach is idiotic. >Be part of the solution - not the problem. The solution is to greatly reduce the authority of the "the authorities". The Feds showed themselves here, as they have so many times in the past, to be a gang of trigger-happy, impulsive, yahoos who cause more trouble than they prevent. Their confrontational approach reinforced every single message Koresh was giving his followers, virtually guarantee- ing that whatever crazy solution Koresh proposed would be followed willingly. This was pointed out here, on Compuserve, in the press, just about every place except in the Justice Department where it seems a n.i.h. philosophy prevails. ---peter	2

EDT THE PRESIDENT: On February the 28th, four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk. Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day standoff ensued. The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life. The Bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably insane. He engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency. He was, moreover, responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in February. Given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound. This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully. The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender. I was informed of the plan to end the siege. I discussed it with Attorney General Reno. I asked the questions I thought it was appropriate for me to ask. I then told her to do what she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision. Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy. Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive. He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued. Now we must review the past with an eye towards the future. I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been done differently. I have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation. I expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review. Finally, I have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the American people. I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances. Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in Waco. I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks. And I hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now. Q Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, after 51 days, you decided -- Q Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with -- THE PRESIDENT: I can't hear you both. If one will go first and then the other. Q Sorry. Can you describe what Janet Reno -- Q Mr. President -- THE PRESIDENT: I'll answer both your questions, but I can't do it at once. Q Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it? THE PRESIDENT: Yes. I was told by the Attorney General that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound. And she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building. And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside. I was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon. They were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire. In fact, as you know, an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials. There were no shots coming back from the government side. I asked a number of questions. The first question I asked is, why now? We have waited seven weeks; why now? The reasons I was given were the following: Number one, that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there. They might be needed in other parts of the country. Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult members to come out. Number three, that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with the passage of time. And number four, that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions. So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time. The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good. She said that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time. The third question I asked was, has the military been consulted? As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation. Military people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it. And so I asked if the military had been consulted. The Attorney General said that they had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance. Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she should proceed and that I would support it. And I stand by that today. Q Mr. President -- THE PRESIDENT: Wait. Go ahead. Q Can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster? THE PRESIDENT: No, I'm bewildered by it. The only reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody. It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold. There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General on the day before the action took place. I talked to her yesterday. I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry King Show, and I talked to her again this morning. A President -- it is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control. I will say this, however. I was, frankly, surprised would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves. (Applause.) I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance. These people killed four federal officials in the line of duty. They were heavily armed. They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, and they were never fired back on. We did everything we could to avoid the loss of life. They made the decision to immolate themselves. And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the children. But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more. And she said, it's because of the children. They have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time. I have to take their word for that. So that is where I think things stand. Q Can we assume then that you don't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of patience? And if you had it to do over again, would you really decide that way? THE PRESIDENT: No -- well, I think what you can assume is just exactly what I announced today. This is a -- the FBI has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time. This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time. We want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way. Is there something else we should have known? Is there some other question they should have asked? Is there some other question I should have asked? Can I say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different? I don't know that. That's why I want the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have. There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world. And we may have to confront it again. And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, particularly when there are children involved. But I do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves. Q Mr. President, were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from February 28th until yesterday? THE PRESIDENT: Well, yes, I got regular reports all along the way. There were lots of other options pursued. If you go back -- you all covered it very well. The FBI -- you did a very good job of it. I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them early on seemed to be working. Some of the children got out, some of the other people left. There was a -- at one point, there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the authorities. And then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward. Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves. That's what they thought. Q Did the government know that the children did not have gas masks? Q congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that? THE PRESIDENT: That's up to the Congress. They can do whatever they want. But I think it's very important that the Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts. And as I said in my statement, if any congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully cooperate. There is nothing to hide here. This was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country. Go ahead, Sarah. Q There are two questions I want to ask you. The first is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks. And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't those people have a right to practice their religion? THE PRESIDENT: They were not just practicing their religion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had violated federal laws, any number of them. Q What federal laws -- THE PRESIDENT: Let me go back and answer -- I can't answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside. And one of the things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of this because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect. They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be sent. And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected. In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work. So that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance. MS. MYERS: Last question. Q Mr. President, why are you still saying that -- Q Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide? And when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments? THE PRESIDENT: What I asked Janet Reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen. And she said -- and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway. And she said that the people who were most knowledgeable about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future. That was the judgment they made. Whether they were right or wrong, of course, we will never know. What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the building burning? I was sick. I felt terrible. And my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up. That's the first thing I wanted to know. Thank you. Q Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision? Isn't it, in the end, your decision? THE PRESIDENT: Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI. I didn't go over every strategic part of it. It is a decision for which I take responsibility. I'm the President of the United States and I signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call. When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had elapsed. She might have made a decision to change her mind. I said, if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. And I do support her. She is not ultimately responsible to the American people; I am. But I think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as well as she could have. Thank you. (Applause.) END1:55 P.M. EDT	2

Seems to me when you isolate someone, try to send them crazy by playing loudspeakers through the night of Tibetan chants, etc., you don`t have much to stand on when they behave as if they are crazy. (I`m not too sure of their sanity to start with.) I am VERY suspicious when the government controls all communication, and sends the press 2 miles away. I have a gut feeling that no-knock warrant, which is sealed, would not stand up to scrutiny. I don`t think no-knock warrants are what the constitution writers had in mind when they gave us rights against improper search and seizure. I don`t think an all-powerful central, high-taxing government was what the constitution writers had in mind when it delagated rights to the citizens and states and restricted central government.	2

How's that for an answer? :-) Seriously, I believe that it depends on wether or not you are talking about a governmental employer or not. In this case, I believe that there should be absolutely no discrimination, direct or indirect, period. I feel this way not because it would offend my moral sensibilities (which it of course would), but because the government is a coercive entity which we cannot escape. It boggles my mind that in my lifetime, there were "whites only" drinking fountains in some parks, but no fountains for others, yet the taxes garnished to support those fountains certainly were not applied to "whites only." In essence, we cannot escape the coercive state. Even Randy Weavers have to pay property tax. On the other hand, private employers are not a monopoly, and their businesses should be run by them, and not by the government, unless they elect to turn their affairs over to that government. #> Why?

I have a lot of interaction (all positive) with my tenants, so I guess that that isn't an issue. But say I were to buy a unit in another town, and have it managed by a third party. Let's say that I have a real aversion to Christians because of the stuff that they buy into hook line and sinker, and because of the lunatic schmucks that they try to get elected. I don't want any of those fish symbols hanging in the window of a house that I own. Should the government intervene? If I was Elie Weizel and the only rental applicant was Tom Metzger, should I be forced to rent this distant unit to him? #> The companies on the Fortune 500, for example, are all privately owned.

So, you approve of the BATF launching a 100-person raid, complete with flack jackets, men hidden in horse trailers, stun grenades, semi-auto weapons on peaceful citizens? who would also accept a search authoried by a court? There is still no proof that the Branch Davidians had illegal weapons. Nothing else was in the jurisdiction of the BATF, unless they were thought to have a still, or be smoking untaxed cigarettes. The automatic firearms violation is a TAX matter ! You don't serve no-knock warrants on someone with .50 CAL MGs.

All the warning signs were there and she ignored them. She provoked Koresh into killing the children. The situation in Waco was similar to a hostage situation with a madman holding a gun against the head of an innocent person. In such a situation, a person who provokes the madman and causes him to pull the gun's trigger is responsible for the death of the hostage. Janet Reno blindly stumbled in there and basically threw a tear gas container at the madman hoping that he would release the hostage.

An article in yesterday's Atlanta Journal stated that there are many scientists who have misgivings that the data being used to determine whether or not global warming is occuring is faulty. The point that the article made is that all long term temperature dataa collected has been in urban areas, and that any heat rise can be attributed to the growth and urbanization of the area. They called it the "asphalt temperature trend". We have no real long term data on remote areas, such as the middle of the Amazon rain forest, or the top of Mt. Everest or the Gobi desert, for that matter. An accompanying article mentioned that a group of scientists at NASA had developed a method for using a satellite to collect temperature data globally, and that preliminary results showed a slight downward trend attributed to the Mt Pinatubo eruption. It went on to say that even with the current downward trend, there appeared to be *NO* change in global temperatures using trend prediction methods for at least the next 50 years.

There is something terribly wrong, however, with a culture which condemns, attacks, and all too often kills any of its members who attempt to get an education.

EDT THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Please be seated. I want to say, first, how delighted I am to be here with Secretary Riley and with Senator Graham. The three of us served as governors together during the 1980s when we worked constantly on strategies to improve our schools, when we led often difficult and long efforts to upgrade the standards in American education and to improve the quality of instruction our children were receiving. There were no two governors whom I admired more during that period than the two who now stand on this stage with the Teacher of the Year. And I think both of them would join me in saying that, after all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been passed and the funds have been raised and allocated, it all comes down to what happens between the teacher and the students in the classroom. That's why today's ceremony honoring the National Teacher of the Year is so important. Tracey Leon Bailey is one recognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative science programs. He's developed and introduced into Florida's classrooms cutting-edge programs in molecular biology and DNA fingerprinting -- subjects usually taught only in college and, I might add, probably only dimly understood here in the Nation's Capital. (Laughter.) Within three years of being hired by a satellite high school, Mr. Bailey's institution had one of the strongest science programs in the entire state of Florida, and it won numerous national and international awards. These advanced programs aren't just for a favored few. Tracey Bailey has inspired all kinds of students, including those previously known as low-achieving or at-risk to reach for excellence and to attain it. This is what our students need and what our country needs. Today, we know that a good future with high wages and rich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a lifetime. The basics aren't enough anymore. All our kids need competence in math and science and advanced problem-solving. That's why Tracey Bailey's accomplishments are so important and why I am so pleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these accomplishments. Tracey, you represent the best in the United States. I'm glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this Apple Award as the Teacher of the Year for 1993. (Applause.) MR. BAILEY: Thank you, Mr. President. It is indeed a great honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nation's 2.5 million teachers. And we appreciate the support that you have shown for education, and we're looking forward to working with you to help redesign and improve our nation's schools. We know that the quality of our children's education will directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape in the years to come. And we thank you so much for your continued support and commitment to our children's education. Thank you again. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: In closing, I would like to also welcome the education leaders in Florida who are here, those representing the national education groups who have also come. I'd like to recognize Tracey's congressman, Representative Jim Bacchus in the back, himself a great advocate of education. And I'd like to remind all of you that the ultimate purpose of the National Teacher of the Year Award is to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to people all across this country who give their lives to our children, all of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their best to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of America. They are, in so many ways, our most important public servants. Thank you very much. (Applause.) END1:29 P.M. EDT	2

Yes the govt handled it in the Rambo Hollywood type style with extreeme Machismo. Perhaps thats not the way to handle it. It is a completely different thing to start asserting as many have done that the government is primarily to blame. The comparisons with the NAZIs in particular are purely gratuitous. Since you have provided a constructive opinion on the issue your post desreves to be taken seriously. Peter Nelson also made some very good points about how a low key approach might have been more effective. The point is though that you learn through mistakes. The govt played the wrong card and lost. Thats not a big deal. They had had four guys murdered at the begining and maybee they just were not prepared for wuite this situation. Who could be? If the same thing were to happen all over again we might perhaps be able to castigate the Govt if they used the same tactics and failed in the same way. As it is I can't say that I would not have made the same mistake. Maybee I wouldn't because I don't as a rule go in for a confrontational situation if I can avoid it. Maybee I would because with all those press about its very difficult not to try the macho stuff. The FBI had information from within the compound we had no access to. They may have calculated that the B-D followers resolve was cracking based on their listening devices within the compound. They knew that Koresh had chickened out of one suicide attempt. This may have been the reason why they considered that fear might have been a weapon for breaking his resolve. Again in Panama they had used the heavy rock music to great effect during Bush's invasion. Funny that few of the Koresh supporters and appologists complain much about the death of several thousand Pananmanian civilians while the US govt attempted to arrest their former ally. |>And please let's not turn this into a pro-gun vs. anti-gun |>discussion.

Koresh negated his civil rights the minute his followers fired on the police helicopter. No matter whether the warrant was or was not technically valid the guys who were carrying it out thought that it was. Thus the assault on them was completely inexcusable no matter what rationalisation people might wish to employ. Of course we have to consider the guns issue. That is the whole core of the question.

Apologies to those who've seen the following before:] To explain my position on the "War On Drugs," I offer this: Drugs And Crime: A New Approach by Ken Barnes Given that: 1. The trade in illegal drugs is responsible for much of the crime which afflicts our nation. 2. People who want drugs (particularly people who are predisposed to addiction) will find a way to get them, whether or not they are legally available. 3. Despite current law enforcement efforts, drugs are readily available to those who want them. 4. Addiction to drugs, both legal and illegal, is responsible for a significant drain on the productive resources of our country, and this occurs in a variety of ways, from the cocaine-addicted babies who are unable to learn, to the spread of disease among addicts, to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse and tobacco smoking. 5. A general economic principle of government is that whatever is subsidized you get more of, and whatever is taxed you get less of. To be most effective in confronting the nation's drug problem, some way must be found to utilize these additional powers of government to make drug dealing and drug use less attractive. While this country's current efforts to combat legal drugs have succeeded in some respects, (there is a greater awareness of the health consequences of smoking, and designated-driver programs have helped reduce drunk driving, for example), the same cannot be said for the "war" on illegal drugs. There remains a core group of illegal drug users which support international networks of smugglers, pushers, growers, processors, kingpins, and gangsters. These networks and their "marketing activities," which include drive- by shootings, corrupting law enforcement authorities, and smuggling weapons, are directly or indirectly responsible for a large proportion of the crimes committed in our country every day. Clearly, illegal drugs and rising crime are linked. It takes only a moment's reflection to recognize how they are linked. The link is money. As with this country's failed effort to prohibit alcohol consumption, a black market has been created, in which greedy local monopolies, like the gangsters of a bygone era, have profited enormously from their illegal trade. The victims of this trade include not only the innocent people unfortunate enough to be caught in the crossfire, but, I would argue, the drug users themselves. Were it not for the black market, and the violent monopoly of the drug lords, drug users might not be the thieves, robbers, prostitutes and murderers they have become in order to pay the high prices the drug lords demand. In the absence of the drug lords, most would be, I believe, simply people with a problem, either a moral problem_or_a medical problem, but_not_a criminal problem. Let me be clear however, I am_not_advocating that we let the criminals who have been preying on our society for these many years of Prohibition off the hook. On the contrary, the new approach I advocate is one which would not result in either the government or private industry getting into the business of promoting crack cocaine, or any other presently illegal drug for that matter. Neither is it an approach which sees law abiding citizens handing over more and more of their freedom and privacy in an effort to track down illegal drug users, until "the land of the free and the home of the brave" looks like a police state. Here then is my proposal: 1. Possession and use of all presently illegal drugs is decriminalized, but buying and selling them remains illegal. 'Potheads' can grow their own marijuana (as many already do today), other drug users can legally import their poison of choice as long as they pay the tariffs, and a barter economy of drug experimenters develops. 2. Because of the barter economy which supplies the drug users, the black market profits that have so enriched the drug lords dwindle. If these drugs can be obtained for 'free' or next to nothing, why buy them? Nevertheless, there will be those who will seek to sell these "noncommercial" drugs even at relatively low prices. Therefore, 3. Law enforcement activity is concentrated on those individuals who continue to buy and sell, and also on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to afford even low prices. But here is where the strategy begins to differentiate between the drug dealers, the victimizers, and the drug users, their victims. 4. Upon arrest for_any_crime,_suspects are permitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a drug test. Those who choose to cooperate are informed that upon conviction for the crime they are accused of, if they are found to be a drug user, they will be institutionalized until they are clean, and only then will they begin to serve their sentence. If they choose to cooperate and are already drug-free, they can begin to serve their sentence right away. Those who choose not to undergo the drug test and are convicted face stiffer fines and serve longer sentences. 5. Institutionalization of drug using criminals serves several purposes: Drug using criminals (and this includes drunk and/or 'stoned' drivers) are separated from their sources of supply, thus reducing the total number of drug users in society at large, and consequently decreasing the demand for drugs on the street, putting more of the remaining drug dealers out of business. Institutionalization provides an incentive for drug using criminals to straighten themselves out, before becoming part of the general prison population. While helping protect society from crime, institutionalization could also serve to deter drug users from becoming criminals, since drug using criminals, unlike other criminals, would be delayed prior to serving their sentences by the additional time it takes for them to sober up. Institutionalization of drug using criminals separate from the general prison population would also provide a closely monitored pool of addicts who could volunteer for research studies of new techniques and treatments for addictive disease, with the potential to benefit both themselves and others. 6. Dealers in illegal drugs are generally not drug users themselves, and this is particularly true of the drug bosses or kingpins running large illicit organizations. Under this proposal, dealers would be more readily identifiable, since upon arrest they would presumably pass the drug test, or else decline to take it in order to avoid having to explain why they are in possession of drugs when it is apparent they do not use them. Declining to take the test, they would of course face stiffer penalties. While each case of attempted sale of a noncommercial drug would have to stand on own its merits, the outcome of a suspect's drug test could provide additional evidence for the prosecution. 7. Just as cigarette taxes have contributed to the decline of smoking in our country by making cigarettes more costly while at the same time providing revenue for anti-smoking campaigns, noncommercial drugs should be taxed, and the money generated should be used to combat their use. Enforcement of this tax should be on a voluntary basis however, and should not be used as an excuse to infringe on the rights and privacy of noncommercial drug users, since to do so would have the effect of reintroducing Prohibition. Instead, drug users will be encouraged to pay the tax by reminding them that if untaxed drugs are ever found in their possession during the course of routine police operations, they will be required to pay the tax immediately or else forfeit their untaxed drugs to be destroyed. If drug dealers are found to be selling noncommercial drugs on which taxes have not been paid, they will face additional prosecution for evading the tax. The strategy of adding tax evasion to drug dealing charges is already in use in some jurisdictions, but its effectiveness is currently limited by the illegality of drug possession. Revenue from drug possession taxes and import tariffs would be used to fund anti-drug advertising campaigns, and provide support to private sector drug treatment programs for those unable to afford treatment. 8. Taxpayer subsidies to all drug producers must be ended. Federal support of tobacco farming is both immoral and wasteful in this era of tight budgets, and the marijuana crops grown illicitly on federal lands in many states must likewise be eliminated. While my proposal would have the effect of permitting the use of what are now illegal drugs, it would hold the users of all drugs responsible for their actions, and I believe, would reduce the harm drugs have on our society, particularly the crime caused by the illegal drug trade. So long as we remain a free nation, with relatively porous borders, and freedom for our citizens to travel, we will always have a drug problem. Whether it takes the form of heroin addicts dying in abandoned buildings, drunk drivers killing and maiming others on our streets, or emphysema patients struggling for breath after a lifetime of smoking, the results are the same: needless suffering and death. As a society we must recognize that while our society permits us to harm ourselves with drugs, as we are already doing (regardless of the drug laws), we must take a stand against the harm that drugs and drug users cause to others. We must particularly oppose the vicious and violent cartels which prey on the weakness of drug users. By taking the profits out of their deadly trade, my proposal goes a long way towards shutting down these powerful criminal organizations. The question of whether drug use is a moral or medical problem depends on which group of drug users you're talking about. Different drugs have different effects, and some are more addictive than others. The addictiveness of a drug also often varies between individuals, and so we have some people who can drink alcohol in moderation, while others find they cannot resist the bottle. Nicotine, which former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop declared to be as addicting as heroin, is a legal drug with known harmful effects, and while some people can stop smoking by willpower alone, others continue to smoke even after treatment for lung cancer. For those individuals who can stop taking drugs on their own, we may argue that because they have chosen to use them, this represents a moral failure on their part, or an unwillingness to face the difficulties of life. But for the addicts, while they may have chosen to use drugs the first time, by the time they discover their addiction it is too late. We cannot hold them responsible for their disease, any more than we would blame someone who is drowning for an inability to swim. Perhaps they should have known not to go near the water, or perhaps someone should have warned them of the danger, but in their present circumstances warnings will not help. Neither does it help for the drug dealers on the shore to be tossing them weights. --Standard disclaimer-- *.x,*dna************************************************************** *(==) Ken Barnes, LifeSci Bldg. * Conservative libertarians * * \' KEBARNES@memstvx1.memst.edu * for Pro-Balance! * *(-)**Memphis,TN********75320.711@compuserve.com********************** "I find television very educating.

You may consider that I am a complete bastard and a not very nice chap. Thats quite true. I don't pretend to be. Being nice is what amateurs try to do. If you want to talk politics you are talking hard decisions such as whether the lives of the troops should be risked attempting to rescue the children. Anyone who has held the office of President of the United States since FDR has held the threat that if the USA or its allies were to be threatened then the USA would risk nuclear Holocaust in order to protect freedom. Beleive it or not, that is not the sort of threat that nice chaps make. Do they have a gun nutters section of the US version of CND by any chance? There are cases where society has to be protected from madmen such as Koresh or Hitler. If it were not for the consideration of the 17 children in there the question of the tactics to be used would not be a matter of anything but academic significance. It is not for the govt to prevent people from commiting mass suicide. The latest reports are that cult members were shot attempting to leave the compound by Koresh loyalists during the fire. If proven that would entail the final nail in the coffin of those who want to promote Koresh as some sort of role model or hero. I need hardly add that it is Koresh that has created the Holocaust in this case by the deliberate arson of the ranch appocalypse. Phill Hallam-Baker	2

Eminent domain is a state-mandated transaction in which one party is required to sell a piece of property which it owns to another party, regardless of whether the first party wishes to sell at all, at a price which is set by the state.

It did something that we as > a capitalistic society should want them to do: build a factory, create > industry and jobs. The cost of compliance was grossly > disproportionate to the damage faced by plaintiffs. Bang. Here's one of the places where we widely diverge. You believe that the courts, in deciding a civil dispute between two parties, should consider as a factor -- perhaps as an overriding factor -- issues which I believe the court should ignore as being irrelevant to the dispute. _Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co._ was an action brought by one party, Boomer, whose property rights were being violated on an ongoing basis by another party, the Atlantic Cement Company. The facts supported Boomer's contention that Atlantic Cement was wrongfully damaging his property, and Boomer asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop doing so. End of story. There was no reason for the court to consider such issues as what a capitalistic society would want Atlantic Cement to do or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage faced by the plaintiffs. Those issues had nothing to do with the case before the court. > Bill, if the government had stepped in and the EPA made a regulation > requiring multi-million dollar cement plants to be shut down because > of a smattering of cement dust, at a cost-benefit ratio of 15+:1, > you'd be up in arms. Why is it okay for the judicial branch to > interfere this way, but not the legislative or executive branches? I'd be up in arms? Why do you assume that? Quite the contrary, I'd probably support the action, since it would be based on the same general doctrine as the decision that I believe would have been correct in _Boomer_: the idea that people's property rights should not be violated for reasons of economic efficiency. In _Boomer_ it was Boomer's property rights which I believe the court should have protected; in the hypothetical EPA ruling you've presented, it's the American people's collective property rights in a healthy physical environment. What good is cost-benefit ratio of 15+:1 if you wind up with cement dust in your air? * * * * * >>> Your rule makes it per se illegal to ever operate a cement plant. >>> If the State of Massachusetts came up with a similar regulation, >>> you'd be up in arms and complaining about interference with >>> property rights, and Fifth Amendment violations.

Yes. So what? The courts are supposed to protect the specific rights of individuals, not the general interests of some nebulous society. If society can have its cement plant without violating anyone's rights, fine. Otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one less cement plant. (See, Ted, I really _am_ a libertarian after all! :-) > That's the whole point behind the Coase Theorem.

Which "one" are you speaking of? _I_ want the legal regime to protect people's rights. Besides, Coase's Theorem only has real application in the never-never land of perfectly rational actors. In the real world (1) some people are going to be stubborn, ornery, spiteful or otherwise "irrational" from a economic point of view and (2) the purpose of the courts is to protect their right to be so. I don't care if you can show me logically that your cattle are only doing $100 of damage to my property per head, so I should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for, say, $150 per head -- I still retain the right to tell you that I just plain don't want any damned cattle on my property, not at any price. * * * * * >> And then you say: "Everyone's property rights were protected; the >> plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were >> avoided."

Why should we treat a nuisance > plaintiff any different than any other tort plaintiff? We don't > require specific performance in the analogous contractual situation; > why in tort? Last question first: For the same reason as in contract law -- because to do so would come dangerously close to treading on the Thirteenth Amendment. As to your "Then, by your argument, no tort plaintiff is ever made whole, because the award of damages in involuntary" claim, you're at least partially right. Faced with situations in which the wrong has already been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place and cannot be reversed or undone, courts will try to set an equitable price tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer to pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim might prefer). In these cases, the "sale" has already taken place and is irreversible, and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is paid, under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances should even a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and (b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or inequitable manner from his victimhood. Both of these doctrines may be worth discussing or debating elsewhere, but neither is relevant to cases like _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it are still in the future and _can_ be reversed/undone (i.e., prevented from happening at all) by order of the court. In these types of cases, all the court has to do is require that the potential victim's property rights are protected until and unless he agrees to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price. There is no need for the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both sides to accept its finding. It can leave that operation up to the parties themselves. >> And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the >> business of ensuring that "unnecessary" settlement costs are avoided? >> (If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were >> supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.) > > Unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive. In cases like _Boomer_, they're simply a cost of doing business. The fact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co. got themselves into a position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a result of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant without _first_ trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whose property rights they'd be violating via the operation of their plant. There's nothing punitive or unjust about it. >> (2) It is "completely sensible" only if you believe that the alleged >> right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid >> losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and >> the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to >> not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who >> own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts. >> [wdstarr] > > Anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire > set of possessions to wronged person? Weren't you complaining about > excess punitive damages before? Anybody who wants to commit a wrongful act in the future should be required to buy the right to do so from the victim, in advance. And the seller should be allowed to set his or her price for the privilege. No injustice, no punitive damages. * * * * * >>> You'd like Posner, Bill. He's a libertarian. >> >>Really?

So we've got a situation where we have several options: 1) The crime rate decreased: Obviously gun control worked. 2) The crime rate remained the same: It would have been worse without gun control. 3) The crime rate increased: Perhaps the laws prevented an even bigger increase. Cute testing ground we've got. All responses support the proposition that gun control works. The question is this: Did Washington D.C. experiance an increase in its violent and/or gun crime rate which was greater than the pattern indicated prior to the implemented gun control laws. If it did, then the suggestion that the problem the gun control laws were designed to "control" did not exist in their entirety prior to the gun control laws. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn.

Since then, President Clinton has directed that a number of steps be taken to move this process forward. The Administration is announcing a number of steps today in order to underscore its deep commitment to a new and closer partnership with Russia based on its government's commitment to reform. Executive Review of Cold War Laws President Clinton and President Yeltsin discussed the desirability of reviewing and updating U.S. laws and regulations to reflect the end of the Cold War. Congress has already acted to revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist Soviet Union has been replaced by a democratic Russia and other independent states. However, many laws and regulations remain that contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the end of the Cold War and that unnecessarily undermine relations with Russia and the other new independent states. The President today has ordered an Executive review of laws and regulations so that, where appropriate and consistent with U.S. security and other national interests, such provisions can be revised or removed. He has asked Ambassador-at-large Strobe Talbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis. The President has indicated that he will welcome congressional efforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible. This review will weigh all considerations that pertain to revision of such provisions, and the initiation of the review may help to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such provisions in the past. For example, because the Russians are eager to have their status changed under the Jackson-Vanik legislation, President Yeltsin personally assured President Clinton in Vancouver that he would look into individual cases involving continuing restrictions on emigration from Russia. By addressing such issues, this review can help strengthen the bonds of trust and partnership between the U.S. and Russia, and between the U.S. and the other new independent states. Review of COCOM It is also time to consider expeditiously with America's allies the future of another Cold War institution -- the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM). The United States has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export controls to the post-Cold War world, in which Russia is no longer viewed as a potential adversary, but as a potential ally in combatting the proliferation of sensitive technology. Steps to Improve the Security Relationship The President also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of efforts discussed in Vancouver that can strengthen U.S. security and improve our security relationship with the Russians and the other states. Accelerated Deactivation of Nuclear Weapons In Vancouver, the two Presidents discussed accelerating the process of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for elimination under the START I Treaty. President Clinton has directed the Department of Defense to complete this process well in advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in START I. In addition, the United States, together with Russia and the other relevant states of the former Soviet Union, will be exploring programs under Nunn-Lugar to help them to accelerate this process. Multilateral Test Ban The two Presidents agreed at Vancouver that negotiations on a multilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date, and that the two governments would consult with each other accordingly. The United States looks forward to beginning consultations with Russia, our allies, and other states, on the specific issues related to this negotiation. The United States expects to start this consultative process within the next two months. Detargeting The two Presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear targeting at Vancouver. As the United States and Russia move into a new relationship of strategic partnership, there is a need to reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the past to safeguard U.S. security against a nuclear adversary. The Administration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures that could enhance strategic stability, including recent proposals for detargeting nuclear missiles. Other Measures to Create a New Security Relationship In response to the incident involving a collision between US and Russian submarines last month, Secretary Aspin will be ready to discuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with Russian Defense Minister Grachev during his visit to the United States in late May. Secretary Aspin will also be prepared to move forward with Defense Minister Grachev in May to develop a combined training program between our two military forces and to prepare for joint exercises in peacekeeping, such as that authorized by the UN Security Council. The United States looks forward to broadening such training and exercises to include other peacekeeping contributors, in order to improve inter-operability, readiness, and planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations. The US and Russia are working together to convene a May Ministerial Meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss proposals for enhancing the UN's peacekeeping capability and to move consideration of the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace from the discussion to the implementation phase. The U.S. is also working with the Russians to focus specifically on improvements in the financing and management of UN operations. The purpose of these initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our participation in UN or CSCE sponsored actions. Multilateral and Bilateral Partnership with Reform Finally, the Administration continues to move ahead on a range of initiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and political reformers throughout Russia and the other states. The Administration is continuing work with our G-7 partners to assemble the package of multilateral assistance that Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher recently negotiated in Tokyo. And the Administration is continuing consultation with Congress over the further efforts the U.S. will take to assist the process of reform in Russia and the other states. * * * The Administration believes these steps can increase American security while improving the relationship between the U.S. and Russia, and between the U.S. and the other new independent states. -30-	2

"So what, >90% of everyone else is straight, I'd never end up with a guy anyway." As several people on soc.bi pointed out to me, this is true only if you find partners (for relationships or just for sex) in primarily straight circles. Nowadays with gay culture quite visible in major cities and such, you can easily find yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you so choose. (About half my friends are bi, and that's just from hanging out in the science fiction club and going to UCBU once a week, it's not as if I have to go out of my way and hang out in bars or something.) So the available pool for dates can be the same size. Unless of course you're trying to date a random sample of the US population. As for promiscuity, I've traded email with Clayton on the topic, and he still doesn't seem to want to admit that yes, gay males are sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because they're closeted and can't afford to be seen in a permanent relationship. Or that part of the promiscuity is because of the messed-up gender roles in our society, and when males are dating males and they've *all* been trained to be the aggressor in sex, there's going to be more sex. Or that what's "dysfunctional", what's "screwed up" is societal attitudes, not gay sexuality, and that's what encourages deviant behavior in gay males. (also note that just because someone's had 200 sex partners doesn't mean they're promiscuous. yes, it sounds ridiculous, but it's quite possible for someone to go through a heavily closeted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with strangers, and then come out, start forming real relationships, and be monogamous or nearly so...) -- ____ Alan Jaffray (jaffray@math.uchicago.edu) Email, 'talk' always welcome. \bi/ Those who dance are thought mad by those who hear not the music -- Anon \/ B0H7f-t+w-cg+(+)k+?s-vm-h-pS6/3bgz-++o-x-v+j+N0178l--+a(+)f-vn-(++)e--+dvb+u+	2

Let me see if I got this right. Group of religious plinter schismatics erect a compound and after at least fifty years of peaceful co-existance with the outside community (having shoot outs only with each other) - this makes them dangerous. Prior history would seem to indicate they are only dangerous to themselves. Last I knew there was no National Branch Davidian Party blaming the debacle in VeitNam on Foreign Meddlers and three-two beer, calling for the Rounding up of Meat Packers, Growers and Slaughter Houses. You want tough political choices - how about letting odd balls be odd balls? (I know, this requires tolerance for those that go into Government - but we all know people who have no useful skills.) ith the death of the children everybody is getting real upset - what about the other 40 plus people? I suppose that you consider children to be property of the state with the family as custodians. (In the States its the other way around - children are parental property.) If what you consider a Corrupt Government demands that you send you children into _their_ tender care - I suppose that you will obey the State and turn you children over to their care.

The number of people showing up at the MOW hardly constitutes the entire queer populace. I doubt that it constitutes more than a handful of us. I'm queer, and I won't be there, simply because I don't have the time or the transportation. What the hell makes you think the participants in the MOW embody more than a minimum number? Face it, people, we're everywhere. There are always more of us than you think. Our numbers are constantly GROWING, not diminishing...some of your children will grow up to join us. Hell, some of MY children may grow up to join us. The best way to deal with this phenomenon is not to fear it and blind yourself to it, but to realize that you have nothing to fear. We're not perverts, we're not dangerous, we're just here, and we're human just like you--er, most of you. Idiots like Cramer and Kaldis can rant all they like. It won't do them one iota of good. Drewcifer P.S. I still can't get over the fact that some people actually believe that every queer in the U.S. would show up at the MOW, and that these numbers are meaningful. And, come to think of it, what about those of us in OTHER countries? Tree. -- ----bi Andrew D.

EDT Q Mr. President, President Havel is here for the Holocaust Museum opening, and you toured the museum last night. All this focus on the Holocaust, how does that weigh on your decision- making process as far as Bosnia is concerned? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think the Holocaust is the most extreme example the world has ever known of ethnic cleansing. And I think that even in its more limited manifestations, it's an idea that should be opposed. You couldn't help thinking about that. That's not to compare the two examples. They're not identical; everyone knows that. But I think that the United States should always seek an opportunity to stand up against -- at least to speak out against inhumanity. Q Sir, how close are you to a decision on more sanctions on Bosnia? THE PRESIDENT: Well, of course, we've got the U.N. vote. Ambassador Albright was instrumental in the U.N. vote to strengthen the sanctions and they are quite tough. And we now are putting our heads at the business of implementing them and looking at what other options we ought to consider. And I don't have anything else to say, except to tell you that I spent quite a bit of time on it and will continue to over the next several days. Q Following your meeting today, sir, are you any closer to some sort of U.S. military presence there? THE PRESIDENT: I have not made any decisions. * * * Q President Clinton, why have you decided to meet with Mr. Havel? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm just honored that he would come and see me. I'm glad he's here in the United States for the dedication of the Holocaust Museum. He is a figure widely admired in our country and around the world, and a very important person in Europe, and a very important person to the United States. So I'm hoping that we'll have a chance to talk about the new Czech republic and what kinds of things we can do together to support the causes we believe in. END5:05 P.M. EDT	2
94	From: Clinton-HQ@Campaign92.Org (The White House) Subject: CLINTON: Press Briefing by George Stephanopoulos 4.20.93 Organization: MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab Lines: 874 NNTP-Posting-Host: life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 20, 1993 PRESS BRIEFING BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS The Briefing Room 12:36 P.M. EDT MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: As you know, the President is going to come out at 1:15 p.m. With your indulgence, I think what we'd like to do is have the President award the National Teacher's Award first and then have the teacher leave, or whatever, and then he'll make a statement on Waco and take a couple questions. So if we can just hold off going live and all that until that's done, it probably will work out a lot better. Q If you'll give us the time. That's the problem. Q We've got a two-minute warning problem. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, it is a problem. It's about 1:15 p.m. Q The teacher would walk off and then -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that's -- I'm just trying to work this out here. I think that's the best way to handle it. Q Can I ask you a series of questions about the way the President handled the notifications yesterday? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Sure. Q Did you, for instance, talk to the Justice Department about who would come out and discuss what had happened in Waco and whether it should be the Attorney General or the President? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Why don't we just take a step even farther back from that and look at the whole sequence of events on the contact between the Justice Department and the White House. As you know and as we've said, the President spoke with the Attorney General on Sunday, Sunday afternoon. They had a good discussion, about 15 minutes. The Attorney General informed the President of what she wanted to do. He raised no objections. Obviously, she had the implicit authority from the President to go forward. He raised no objections. She went forward. They had a discussion of a general nature about the incident. Again, yesterday morning around 11:00 a.m., the President spoke with the Attorney General again. They had a brief discussion over what was happening in Waco. As you know, this was before the fire broke out at the compound. And I think that was why there was some -- just some confusion. I think that she was confusing in her minds before and after the fire, not the actual day when they spoke. Then there was a number of contacts at a number of different levels in the White House yesterday afternoon between the Justice Department and the White House. They were informing us of their decisions, what they would like to do. There was an FBI briefing in Waco. The Attorney General had her press conference. The President then issued a statement after that. Frankly, yesterday afternoon, you know, there was a fair amount of confusion over exactly what was happening on the ground in Waco, and I think that we wanted to be very careful not to have the President say anything until we had a much better sense of what was actually happening on the ground. Once we were fairly clear on what was happening on the ground in Waco, the President issued a statement. He spoke with the Attorney General again yesterday evening. Q At what hour was that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: It was quite late. I believe it was after he returned from the Holocaust Museum. He took a tour of the Holocaust Museum last night. Q And he went out to dinner. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I believe briefly. Yes, he went to dinner and then he spoke with the Attorney General last night. I don't know the exact time; I think it was relatively late. And he just said, I think as Dee Dee has reported, that he just wanted to tell her that he thought she handled a difficult situation very well, that she did a good job in a tough situation, and that she should try and get some sleep. He then, again, spoke with her this morning about the follow-up in Waco, and about what they're going to do this afternoon. As you know, the President will have an announcement to make at 1:15. Q Did he ever talk with Webb Hubbell yesterday, last night, or this morning? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not to my knowledge, no. Q Was Webb Hubbell the point man for the White House? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Webb Hubbell is the general White House Liaison and several people talked to Webb. The Attorney General was running the operation. Q Did he tell her that she should sleep well, that she had done a good job? Or he just tell her that she should get some sleep? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think sleep well -- done a good job -- I don't know the exact words. I think that sounds right. Q I mean, sleep well has implications as to conscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I mean, I think everybody feels badly when you have a situation when -- Q I understand that, but whether the issue of blame is brought up in that phraseology. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that's the spirit -- no, it has nothing to do with that. The spirit with which it was offered was that the entire administration and certainly the Attorney General had to face a very difficult decision, a very difficult situation yesterday. And that he thought that she had handled it well, as best as she could and -- Q Well, does he think it was mishandled? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: -- it was just speaking of warm words to a friend. Q Does he think the situation was mishandled? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President -- Q In retrospect? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President stands by the decisions of the law enforcement agencies, the decisions of the Attorney General. He accepts full responsibility. At the same time, I think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what exactly happened, do a full review, and make sure we do what we can to make sure this doesn't happen -- this kind of thing doesn't happen again, or at least we know how to handle it. Q How much did he know about what she was going to go ahead with? I know that she made the case to him -- explained -- outlined the case for action. Did she say to him on Sunday precisely what action? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't think it was specific operational detail as to what was going to happen. I think that they had a general discussion about the action, about the advisability of action. I think, as she noted, he asked a few general questions just trying to get a sense of how things were considered. But it wasn't minute-by-minute detail of how the operation -- Q Well, was it, "we are going in." Is it, "we're going to use tear gas"? I mean, what? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I believe it was that we want to go in and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in the compound, and hopefully spur them towards some sort of movement out. Q George, was there ever a conscious political decision made, or even a discussion about distancing the President from -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not at all. I mean, we were in close contact with the Justice Department. The President accepts responsibility for this. At the same time -- I mean, we just wanted to be very, very clear about how this happened and be as factual as we could be on how the decisions were made. It is the responsibility of those on the ground to make recommendations. The Attorney General has operational control over this. The President obviously accepts responsibility for all of this, and he stands by the Attorney General. Q George, there was a report on the television today -- and I don't know more than that -- one of the members of the cult had said going into a courthouse that the FBI had started the fire and not themselves. There was also a picture yesterday on the TV of a smashing into the building where the fire broke out. And my question is, is the White House absolutely certain that this fire was -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: All the evidence we have is that this fire was started by David Koresh and those inside the compound -- every bit of evidence we have. Q Did the President ask the Attorney General why do this now, why this particular date, and did he ask about possible consequences of either death or injury? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know the specific questions. He had general questions about how the decision was going about being made. Q Those are general questions and did he ask generally, why now? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think he asked, have you considered all of the consequences; have you considered the recommendations? I don't know if he asked the question, "why now? " I don't know if he asked that specific question. Q Did she tell him why now in terms of the stuff that's come out since then about the information provided by the listening device about Koresh getting increasingly more violent? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, I'm not certain how much specific detail they got into. I know that she generally said that this is the recommendation she's prepared to make, I mean, the decision she's prepared to make. It's based on the recommendations she was receiving from the field and after intensive questioning of those involved. Again, I do not know how precisely detailed it was beyond that. Q What is the President's understanding why yesterday? One of the people who went into the compound a couple weeks ago came out over the weekend with some speculation that he may have told law enforcement people something that precipitated this action. Why yesterday? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: This is the first I've heard. I think what we can go to is what the FBI and the Attorney General has said. There were indications that those inside the compound were at some danger. It was clear that the negotiations had broken down and it was the judgment of the experts involved in the negotiations that the situation was not going to get any better at all. There was also some concern over the vulnerability of the agents themselves who had been working long beyond the time that these teams normally have to work. And as the Attorney General has said, there was some concern over the fact that they did not have replacements in place who could stand in for them, and there was a concern over the safety. All of these factors came into play. They also considered the advice of a number of psychologists and other experts on David Koresh and those in the compound. I would just go back to what the Attorney General has said. You have to make the best judgment you can, given the information you have at the time. They did. Obviously, we all regret the loss of life. It's a terribly unfortunate situation. We all wish it could have turned out differently, but that doesn't take away from the judgments that were made at the time. Q George, when did the President know that they were going to use tear gas? Was it before the assault on the compound? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I just don't know. I don't believe he was given a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go. I just don't know. Q Along that point, George, can you say whether the plan was presented to the President by the Attorney General as a way to end the standoff one way or the other yesterday? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think it was presented as a way to increase the pressure on those in the compound and, we all hoped, as a way to move some of those out and bring it in -- it wasn't presented as tomorrow is D-Day, this is it. Q Is the President satisfied that, A, he had all this relevant information necessary to make a decision, and B, that Janet Reno had all the relevant information necessary to make a decision? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Oh, I think he's satisfied that they were acting on the best advice and the best information they had, and he's not second-guessing it in any way whatsoever. Q George, was there a 12-hour gap between conversations between the President and the Attorney General? In other words, they spoke at 11:00 a.m. and they didn't speak again until Clinton got back from dinner at -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that's likely, yes. Q Did he call her? What time did she call? Was there a gap between when she called him? I mean, was he at dinner when she called and -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, no, no. I think he called her last night. I couldn't swear to it, but I believe he called her last night. He just wanted to talk to her. Q what was going on? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not that I know of, no. Q What do you know about the situation now? Everyone has perished who -- except eight or nine? And do you know any of the other details? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know any more details than the FBI reported in Waco. Q watching CNN or how was he keeping track of what is going on? If he wasn't talking to his Attorney General, how was he keeping track of what was going on here? I mean, with all due respect to CNN, is that how he was doing it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. There was also -- as I said, several people in the White House were in constant contact with their counterparts at Justice to have the full and complete information. Q Who were those contacts? I mean, was it Mack McLarty, Webb Hubbell? How was the President being kept informed? That's not a -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I believe Mack was in contact with Webb. I spoke with several people at the Justice Department. I believe Bruce Lindsey spoke with people at the Justice Department. Either Bernie or Vince was also in contact at different times during the day with people at the Justice Department. We were fully briefed and fully informed. Q We were told this morning that the President may have spoken -- a chance that he may have spoken with Webb. Do you know if that's true or not? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think there's a chance he may have. I don't believe he did, but I think there's certainly a chance that he may have at some point. I don't believe he did. I think that the last contact he had during the day yesterday directly with the Justice Department was the 11:00 a.m. phone call with the Attorney General. But the White House was fully informed on a minute-to-minute basis of what was happening in Waco and what was happening at the Justice Department. Q George, who decided that the briefing would be done by the Attorney General? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The Attorney General. Q Did you or did the White House communications staff -- were you ever involved with that decision? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. We were told about it. Q Did you ask her to go on Nightline and MacNeil- Lehrer and all that stuff? Was that part of -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. Q there was no advice from the White House at all about her -- she was on all night, all day. (Laughter.) MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, and she did a very good job. Q Why did you decide to have the President's reaction to the situation be only a written statement, which is traditionally the White House's way of distancing the President from the issue, not having him appear as personally saying anything? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, that wasn't the intent at all. As I said, we had to -- we wanted to wait until we had all of the information at hand. The President is also making a statement today. The President made a statement yesterday morning. The President has been fully involved -- Q After this turned into less than a successful operation, the only statement from the President was what was on paper after the Attorney General had already given what amounted to the major facts in this. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, it was the first statement from the President, not the only statement from the President, number one. Q After the -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Number two -- well, the first. Number two, the Attorney General -- Q He gave a statement early in the morning when the thing was starting to move -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Right. And he gave one yesterday and he's giving one today. Now, the second point -- Q It just happens this was a written statement with no sort of communications policy or thought process involved? It was the President wants to put out a written statement? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Knowing what we knew at the time, we thought it was appropriate for the President and he thought it was appropriate to put out a written statement expressing his regret and expressing his support for the Attorney General's -- Q Why was it not appropriate for him to personally do something? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, he did personally do so. That is his statement. It's a statement under his name. Q George, yesterday during the briefing you didn't say the President took full responsibility for what happened -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I certainly did. Q No, what you said was -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: That's just not right, Susan. Q Well, I think you can go back to the transcript, I mean, unless I miss something -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'd love to. Q Janet Reno said that she took full responsibility and you said that she made the decision, that the FBI -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: And the President takes responsibility. Absolutely. Q Took responsibility -- all right. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Check the transcript. Q Considering how little was known about what was going on inside the compound and, even now, how little is known, why is Washington calling this a mass suicide? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I think that knowing what we know now and given all of the actions of David Koresh before and during, it is painfully clear that those there were under his control. Q It's stretching it a little bit where the kids are concerned, though, isn't it, George? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that that is an entirely different matter. I mean, I think that David Koresh must bear responsibility for the deaths of those children, absolutely. But he clearly was intent on creating some kind of an apocalyptic incident, and that's what he did. Q You're still operating completely on assumption, right? I mean, you have no evidence, or you know of no evidence that this was mass suicide. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We have evidence that those inside the compound set fire to the compound, which led to the deaths of those inside. Q I didn't quite hear it. This might be Ann's question, I didn't quite hear it. But at what time did Clinton himself put out a statement on this? I know Dee Dee said some stuff on this at 6:00 p.m., but the President put out -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: At 6:35 p.m., 6:40 p.m. Q Right after the evening news went on the air? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, right when we had all the information. We were working on it. Q Dee Dee confirmed this morning that the investigation the President is going to announce is going to be an administration-run investigation. Why not have someone from the outside to make sure that it's not colored by those who would have a political stake, particularly those at the ATF whose actions have already been -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that clearly the ATF and the Justice Department will bear responsibility for the investigation. That's not to rule out, as is often in investigations like this, having some sort of independent involvement as well. But it will be run by the Treasury and Justice. Q Are you confident that you will not have any problem getting -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely. Q George, did the President reach out to anybody else to get advice after the meeting with Janet Reno? And who else in the White House sat in on that meeting? Anyone else from Justice? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't believe anybody else was there at the time. It was a phone call on Monday, it wasn't a meeting. Q Sunday. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Sunday. It was a phone call, it wasn't a meeting. I believe he might have been there with Bruce, but beyond that, I think he just talked to the Attorney General. Q George, you said that in that phone call, she said that we want to go in and take action, as you said, that will force him out. What did he think she was talking about? If he didn't know about tear gas, what exactly was his idea of what he was approving? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think he was approving an action to increase the pressure on -- qQ It didn't matter how she did that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, no. I mean -- Q What information did he have in terms of how this would proceed? Presumably he would have wanted to know, not minute- by-minute, but in a general sense -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think he knew that this was the recommendation of those on the ground and the recommendation of the law enforcement agencies. I just don't know -- Q What is "this" -- when you say that "this" was the recommendation -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The action to increase pressure. I don't know exactly what he was told -- whether he was going to be told that the tank was going to go up to the left wall and punch a hole in the window, or whether he was just told generally that they were moving forward in a way that would increase the pressure. I just don't know. Q It's hard to imagine him not asking, though. Q that Janet Reno presented him with as her best advice about what they should go forward with, he would have agreed? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: He was -- he did ask some general questions about the advice and recommendation he gave. At the same time -- and I would repeat -- that this was based on the unanimous recommendation of the law enforcement agencies involved. Q George, it would seem that this question about just exactly in what detail the President was informed about the nature of the operation is going to come up again here and elsewhere. Can you take that question and -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely. Yes. Q get the answer and come back to us with all of it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q Can you tell us that there was never a meeting -- a strategy session -- where you and others decided, we will put out a written statement from the President and we will have Janet Reno be on all of these television broadcasts? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Never. Never. Q And you never called the Justice Department and said to anyone or Janet Reno, "you're the one who needs to be out front explaining this"? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not once. Q It just happened that way that she was the spokesman, that no one ever saw Bill Sessions until -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: She made a decision as Attorney General that it was important for her as the operational officer in charge, as the person who made the decision, to go out and take the questions on this tragic incident. Q She had no guidance from the White House at all? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We certainly didn't object. Q But did you -- (laughter) -- no, I'm sure you didn't object, but did you suggest it? Was this a plan -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. Absolutely not. Q a strategy? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. Q Did she clear it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. Q Did she notify you? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We certainly knew about it. Q What happened to this great detailed process you have for clearing and talking to every public information officer and every -- under every rock and every place in government that something as major as this could have occurred without a discussion between you and the public information people at least at the Justice Department? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The Attorney General made the decision and the Attorney General wanted to go forward. It seemed like a good decision. It was a good decision. She did a good job. Q Let me ask it this way, George, if in hindsight how you would handle it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think it was handled very well. Q You wouldn't change a thing if -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Change what? Q The way the White House handled any part of it -- from start to finish. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I think that's an awful broad question and we're certainly going to have a review. One of the reasons for the investigation is to look for ways in the future that something like this -- see what we can learn from an incident like this and see what we can learn about how to handle them. If you're talking specifically about the issue of the press conferences, no, there -- wouldn't make any change at all. Q Two questions: First of all, on her going on TV, no White House people or outside media consultants came up with this idea? It's just very reminiscent of what you guys did during the campaign. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: How so? Q I'm thinking of like watching Clinton on Nightline after the draft story; watching Clinton on -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: There's absolutely no comparison. Yesterday there was a law enforcement incident. The incident ended in tragic deaths of many, many people. The Attorney General was involved in that decision. The Attorney General made the decision to do that. She felt it was her responsibility in the interest of public information to go out and take the questions of the press in order to make sure that all of the questions were answered, and she did a fantastic job. Q The second question is, did -- as someone who knows Clinton as well as you do, can you understand why it's sort of hard to believe that he might not have asked some detailed questions about what she intended to do? In other words, she came and she said, I'm going to put pressure on them. It's hard not to see Clinton, who's fairly intelligent and inquisitive, asking how. Q What kind? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Both the Attorney General said that he did ask questions, he did ask general questions. I don't have a minute-by-minute account of the conversation. Q How long a conversation? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think it was about 15 minutes. Q Telephone conversation? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q George, was the federal cost of this standoff ever a consideration in terms of stepping up the pressure -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't believe so, no. Q George, you keep saying that the President takes full responsibility, but then you refer to it as her decision. Does the President not accept the fact that as Commander-In-Chief, it is ultimately his decision? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know what this has to do with Commander-In-Chief. This was a law enforcement action, not a military action. And he clearly takes responsibility for the decisions of the law enforcement agencies involved taken in his government. I mean, I think there's just no ambiguity about that. Q But is he accepting it as his decision as well as hers, or is he saying it's her decision? There's a difference. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: As a matter of fact, it was her decision. He did not object to that decision. He clearly takes full responsibility. Q George, this briefing has gone on just a little over 15 minutes, and as you can see a lot of things can be exchanged. What exactly did they spend 15 minutes talking about if it was just very general? That's a long period of time in a phone conversation. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: It is an awful long phone conversation. It was a very important phone conversation. I think Brit has asked that we take the question, and I've said that I would. Q One of the things Reno said last night is that the buck stops here. I think that was her direct quotation. Does the President agree with that in this case? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President says he accepts full responsibility. I think what the Attorney General was saying is that she made a decision, that she's going to accept all the responsibility that comes to her. And she's not shrinking from that at all, but neither is the President. Q At any point in the conversation last night between the President and the Attorney General or this morning, did she ever offer her a resignation? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not to my knowledge. Q Even before the fire was out yesterday, there were some Republicans on Capitol Hill calling for an investigation. Is the White House at all concerned about the timing of those requests trying to make political hay out of this situation? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. And I don't want to cast any questions about the motives of those who are requesting investigation. We want an investigation, and we'll have a full and complete investigation. Q In what forum will you answer Brit's question? Will you put out a written statement? Will you -- the wires? How will you answer the question that you've taken? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm just not sure. Q George, can you remind us what the President was doing all yesterday afternoon, where he was, and what meetings he was involved in? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'll have to try and remember. He had a series of meetings with different members of the staff during the afternoon. He was certainly monitoring the situation in Waco and getting periodic reports on that as well. He did see some on CNN as well. I believe he saw a fair amount of the FBI press briefing as well. Q And those reports would have come to him from Mack McLarty, would they -- do you think? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Mack talked to him, Bruce talked to him, I talked to him. Q George, to follow Helen's question, in their conversation this morning did they discuss at all her statement last night in response to the question about whether she would resign? Did he say, I don't know why you felt the need to say that? I'm here to reassure you that you don't have to do this? Did that come up at all? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know if it even came up that specifically. I know that the bulk of the conversation was discussing where do we go from here and what form the investigation -- Q The didn't talk at all about her kind of remarkable comment last night about -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I believe she was asked a question. Q And her response was, if the President wants me to, I will. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Which would be, I think, the standard response that most Cabinet members would give. I mean, it's a conditional statement. Q have a need to talk about whether -- personally about whether the President wanted her -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know if they talked about it. I mean, what I learned about the conversation was that it was largely about the investigation itself. And this just didn't come up. I did not ask the question if they talked about -- Q Will you take that with the Brit package? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Certainly. (Laughter.) Q George, for the record, does the President want her to resign? I know Dee Dee answered this morning -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely not. He supports Janet Reno. She's a good Attorney General. She's done a good job. She handled a difficult situation extremely well. Q George, does the President feel that he and Janet Reno were let down by the unanimous professional advice from the law enforcement experts on the ground? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. And the President is not second-guessing that decision and those recommendations in any way. That is not to say that he doesn't regret the loss of life. Everybody regrets the loss of life in this situation. But the best judgments were made in a difficult situation based on the best information we had. Q George, the 15-minute conversation was the one on Sunday, is that correct? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q How long was the one at 11:00 a.m. yesterday morning? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know. I'll take that question, too. Q Were these outside experts that they were consulting with, or experts within the ATF and the FBI? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: You'd have to ask them. I'm just not sure. I know that there were several experts. Q And also, why weren't there replacements for these people? Is the unit that small? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, I think it is a very small highly-specialized unit. But I think it's one of the kinds of things that the investigation will examine. Q George, isn't there a factor here involving the FBI Director? Normally, a president, when he wants to get information, doesn't only asks the Attorney General. I know the chain of command. But presidents talk to their FBI directors. In this case, throughout this entire siege, he has not felt that he could pick up the phone and talk to Bill Sessions, who is from Waco, and get expertise from him on what to do and what not to do? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think he talked to the FBI Director well in the beginning of the situation when it first broke out in Waco. At the same time, the Attorney General bears the ultimate responsibility and he was getting fully briefed from the Attorney General. Q Don't you think the ambiguous situation that Director Sessions is in has some impact on the way the President is briefed and on the way that all of this evolved? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not at all. I mean, it's perfectly appropriate that he be briefed by the Attorney General and that the Attorney General has supervisory authority over the FBI Director, and that's following the chain of command. THE PRESS: Thank you . END 1:03 P.M. EDT #60-04/20	2

Why have >you omitted that level from your model? Yes, and the individual is not omitted; I just didn't fully articulate the principles of Fractal Federalism. All government powers derive from the People; each level can receive a new power from the level below through the amendment process, where a true consensus (say a 3/4 majority) writes that power into the Constitution of the level above (in the case of the lowest level, an amendement is passed by a 3/4 majority vote; in the case of higher levels, it must be passed by 3/4 of the legislatures. We can of course haggle about the specifics of "true consensus" when we hold our Constitutional Convention :-). Once a power has been granted, it may be exercised by the legislature. Powers not in the original Constitutions must percolate upward, starting from the individual. The ratification process for the original Constitutions should involve consensus and not simply a plurality or majority. Granting a "right" in a constitution is of course the same as empowering the government at that level to restrict the activities of the governments at the lower levels, so it operates in the same way as the amendment process (again, that crazy resemblance to the supposed-but-not-actual U.S. government structure). This government structure is a very frustrating one for those people (read- "liberals") who would like to have concentrated power to use the government to force people to do "good" (a difficult-to-define word, and one that it is difficult to reach a consensus on). It is also a frustrating structure for those who want to use the government to dictate personal behavior (read- "big-government conservatives"). I personally would rather see those types of people frustrated than the incredible erosion of liberty (both civil and economic) that is going on now. This is IMHO a "good" government stucture for those who see the role of government as the protection of individual liberties, while still recognizing that individuals need to have some influence in the type of community that they live in. >> 2) A free market works on government, not just economics. Succesful >> ideas propogate, unsuccessful ideas die. >What is your definition of a "successful" idea or a "successful" >government? One which maintains peace, liberty, and the opportunity for happiness for its people, while working within the realities of human nature. You do bring up the point (intentional or not) that a "lasting" idea is by no means necessarily a "successful" idea. I believe that Fractal Federalism would at least bring many ideas to light, and The People would have the opportunity to democratically choose between "good" ideas and "bad" ideas. If the Docialists, er, I mean Democrats are right and government activism fosters a prosperous People, they will have a plethora of local opportunities to check their thesis. If Libertopia is possible, it will arise. If a balanced Conservative Republic is democratically received as the best level of government activity, it will become clear to The People that it is best. >> As far as "set the moral tone" is concerned, if a community does not >> collectively want to put up with prostitution going on in front of >> their kids, why should they have to?

Right, and people would not rescind any freedoms (read- "empower the government") except through the amendment process. That is how the Federal Government is supposed to work now, but the Supreme Soviet, er, I mean the Supreme Court put a stop to that "republican government" nonsense. In my hypothetical government, if there were a constitutional provision empowering the government to regulate churches the government (whatever level we are talking about) could indeed ban churches. The constitutional provision would be invalid if a higher level had a constitutional provision protecting free exercise of religion. The uppermost Constitution is still the Supreme Law of the Land. >(I find it interesting that you applaud the idea of free-market >competition among various ideas, and yet support the right of he >majority in a community to suppress ideas which they don't like.) It is a matter of individuals being able to control their own associations and environment, not a matter of suppression of ideas. One dilemma of the human condition is that individuals need liberty, and they also need to have some control over their environment. In my "Fractal Federalism" government, certain "rights" are protected by the constitutions. Other "rights" are protected simply because the government has not been empowered to infringe upon them. When a consensus is reached that the government should have a certain power, then freedom is infringed upon. This cannot be avoided -- murder statutes infringe upon freedom, but I think that the consensus of the American people is that murder statutes are a good idea. I am sure that many parents believe that they have a "right" to control the environment that their children live in. People feel that they have a "right" to sleep peacefully at night; thus, there are noise ordinances. There are zoning laws that keep businesses from overrunning residential neighborhoods. I do not view these as bad things (certainly some individual instances are bad, but the concept is not necessarily bad), I view them as the people in a community having some control over the type of community that they live in. I see the alternative as near anarchy. Like I said in another post, if you can come up with a scenario where an individual can do something truly autonomously -- with absolutely zero effect on anyone else -- then no individual or government has the right to restrict that activity. There are simply not very many behaviors that fit into the category of the truly autonomous, so the whole thing becomes an issue of one individual or group having power over another individual or group. I think that the "Fractal Federalism" approach is a sound, if not ideal, approach to limiting this restrictive power. The libertarian scenario degenerates to "might makes right," and the system we have right now is one of "lawyers abusing natural rights philosophy to decide what powers the government should have by subverting the democratic process though the Supreme Court." >> The problem with the egalitarian view is that it tries to deny the >> fundamental dilemma of democratic government: The People have a right >> to exercise a voice in their community, yet individuals have the right >> to be left to themselves.

I think I answered this above already, but let me expand a little more with an example. If I stand naked in front of your house and masturbate in front of your children while they play, in your libertarian (small 'l') scenario the only recourse you have is to yell at me. "Autonomous" is a value judgement 99.99% of the time, it is not a scientific reality with a clear definition. Exactly who would you empower to make that value judgement? >[stuff deleted] >> Certainly not the only cause, Mike, but people in a local neighborhood >> should have a voice in what goes on in that neighborhood.

Lots of people are long on complaints and short on practical solutions. Although I am pessimistic that my idea will ever bear fruit, I am at least trying to be long on solutions also. I am truly interested if you have any improvements to make on my ideas (I call them "my ideas", but they all come from an "average guy" reading of the U.S. Constitution without benefit of the indoctrination of Constitutional Law academia). >But I have to say that I think that your solution is at least just as >bad.

When I said that "Fractal Federalism" resembles the U.S. constitution, I meant it and thought it was pretty clear. I should have more clearly explained that the ultimate derivation of government power is from the CONSENSUS of the people (although not the CONSENT of every individual; a practical observation, not a moral judgement). It is certainly better than having all government power derive from nine lawyers, which is the situation we have now. That is why I think the Supreme Court should be a jury court, with a different jury for each case. It is certainly not perfect (no philosophy of government is), but do you still find it a repugnant idea? If so, what is your solution? >> Ideally, everyone would leave everyone else alone and no government >> coercive power of any kind would be necessary.

101	From: techie@cellar.org (William A Bacon) Subject: The earth also pollutes...... Organization: The Cellar BBS and public access system Lines: 72 FURY OF MOTHER NATURE Man's contribution to environmental "pollution" are paltry compared to those of nature. In her exceptional book TRASHING THE PLANET, former Atomic Energy Commision Chairman Dr. Dixie Lee Ray notes based on the available data, "all of the air polluting materials produced by man since the beginning of the industrial revolution do not begin to equal the quantities of toxic materials, aerosols, and particulates spewed into the air from just three volcanoes: Krakatoa in Indonesia in 1883, Mount Katmai in Alaska in 1912, and Hekla in Iceland in 1947." To which could be added Mount St. Helens in Washington State in 1980 (which pumped out 910,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide alone). El Chicon in Mexico in 1982 (which sent more than 100 million tons of sulfur gases into the stratosphere), and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines (which in 1991 hurled upwards of 30 million tons of material into the stratosphere). LOS NINOS Many environmentalists attributed the 1988 drought in the U.S. to global warming, but researchers with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder Colorado reported that the freakish weather was actually due to a natural phenomenon, the interaction of El Nino and El Nina, two massive currents in the tropical Pacific. El Nino is a huge strip of warm water that periodically appears off the coast of South America and disrupts the world's weather patterns. Now and then, it alternates with El Nina, a mass of cold water that comes from the ocean depths along the equator and drifts for thousands of miles. CHICAGO TRIBUNE'S Peter Gorner summarized the phenomenon: "Cold water along the equator clashed with warmer than normal water southeast of Hawaii. The result was both the U.S. drought and the devastating floods that swamped Bangladesh...... Nina's cooler water disrupted tropical weather patterns and distorted the path of the Jet Stream across North America. Then the Jet Stream shoved rain-producing weather systems away from the interior of the U.S. resulting in drought." TERMITE TERROR Sundry animals and insects also contribute their share to environmental "degradation. TIME for April 20,1992 noted that in "the Netherlands... manure from pigs poses a major ecological threat, defiling water supplies with excessive nitrites and acidifying local soils. Sheep have permanently scarred the landscape in Spain and Portugal, while in India ... bovines [cows] are ravenous wraiths whose constant quest for food drives them to ravage standing forrests." The February 1983 issue of SCIENCE DIGEST reported that "an international team of researchers has discovered that termites generate more than twice the Carbon Dioxide that fuel burning does." According to a study reported in SCIENCE for November 5, 1982, the "estimated gross amount of Carbon Dioxide produced [by termites] was more than twice the net global input from fossil fuel combustion." In addition, "Termites are a potentially important source of atmospheric methane: they could account for a large fraction of global emmisions." The wood-eating pests have a bacteria that enables them too digest carbon so efficiently that some 90 pe is converted too Carbon Dioxide, methane, and other gases they belch into the atmosphere. Ants are another natural source of "pollution." In 1987, an atmospheric chemist with Bell Laboratories, and zoologists from Cornell University, reported that ants of the subfamily FORMICINAE make and store huge quantities of the formic acid that contributes most of the acidity of rain that falls in remote areas and is found in atmosphere gas and precepitation around the globe. It is abundant, for instance, in the fog and mists that hang over the rain forests of Central Africa. According to the July 6, 1987 INSIGHT magazine, the "ants release the acid when defending themselves and communicating with each other and upon dying. Since 30 percent of the world ant population belongs to this subfamily, there is significant concern about the acid the ants release," an amount estimated at "600,000 metric tons annually." which is equal to the combined formic acid contributions of automobiles, refuse combustion and vegetation." Clearly, man has a long way to go to match nature as a "despoiler" of the environment. By Robert W. Lee. ------ techie@cellar.org (William A Bacon) The Cellar BBS - (215) 539-3043	2

As you're no doubt aware, Phill, there are probably five or six different, mutually contradictory versions of the events in Waco on Feb. 28 all of which are from reputable news sources, ranging the the Associated Press to TIME to Newsweek. Some of the earliest reports issued by the AP were not at all flattering the to BATF, and produced some question as to who fired first. Now, for all I know, you were there to witness it.

The BATF, in a letter they've been sending out to people, says both that they were ambushed because they lost the element of surprise, and that they went up and knocked on the door and had it slammed in their faces. It strikes *me* as kind of strange to rely on surprise to serve a warrant by knocking on the door.

Why? Says who? Why can mon & pop have FOA, but IBM be forced, and force is the correct word here, to have REO? As purchase of IBM is voluntary, then there are very well defined procedures on how IBM chooses to do some things and chooses to do other things. Why not let those same procedures work for employment policies? >Similarly, if a landlord owns a number of apartment buildings >in which he does not live, and which are managed by an >independent management agency, then whose freedom of >association are we protecting?

(I've put "good" in quotation >marks because I really don't want to be drawn off into the >side issue of what constitutes a good tenant.) Why does this tenant have an "option" (I won't call it a right) to destroy the FOA of the landlord? If the landlord and the tenant can't agree, then they both can cease from using each other's property. Suddenly, by arm waving, by magic, a landlord does not have FOA. And on what basis does the FOA of the landlord "disappear"? It seems that vague terms like "no contact with tenants" suffice. Well, I think FOA is one our most important rightts (in the top 2-3), and by golly, if the State is going to make it suffer, I sure would like to see the heinous crime that justifies the removal of this right. I don't think "no contact" with the tenats is even a crime, much less something that should cause severe interference with important rights. >I suspect that the majority of the people in this country >agree with my position on these extreme cases, particularly >if they are presented in this manner.

I assume that when you say "publicly owned", you are talking about those quasi-State companys that do NOT have shareholders. The companies on the Fortune 500, for example, are all privately owned. They can give you a list of all of their owners. They have no "anonymous", unknown to them, owners. >By the way, the above analysis is based on the assumption >that the right to freedom of association and the right to an >equal opportunity are both fundamental human rights of equal >importance.

FOA can be derived by any two rational people, on a basis that neither has evil, malicious, or murderous intent towards the others. In short, agreement is mutual, or not at all. Your REO on the other hand, lives only by accepting coercion, the gun, into the situation. And that is self-destructive of the whole argument, because it is based only on might makes right.

If we had lived Certainly many religious beliefs seem to be positive principles for everyday living. Indeed, I believe it is the Islamic religion which avoids alcohol (I apologize if I name the wrong religion) and that is certainly a physical positive in many respects. However, this proves nothing. Just because something is a "basic, pragmatic principle of day-to-day living" TODAY doesn't mean it evolved from the same. Especially those beliefs and (mostly) positions held based on interpretations of the religion. Religious beliefs come from many places but most will be backed up (after many levels of arguments) to "Because that's how it is written." or "God says..." Now I'm not faulting that but that is not a basic, pragmatic principle as you mean it in this context. It is a belief based on faith, which by definition is not necessarily backed up by logic. Faith is a given. God is a absolute truth when arguing from religion. Also, many religions would reject your thesis that their beliefs simply come from these day-to-day principles. In summation, if you wish to use religious arguments be prepared to back them up with "It says in the [fill in religious document here]," because most religions (things which at least I denote as religions) are based on the writings of or teachings of [fill in religious figure here].

Just maybe you won't be home. Then you can come home to something like this: "Well, it's been a rough month," begins Johnnie Lawmaster. "I just get laid off, and my divorce became final. But I just wasn't ready for what happened this particular Monday." That particular Monday was was December 16, the first day of the Bill of Rights' third century, the day when federal agents and local law enforcement officer broke into the house in Tulsa that always flew the U.S. flag. When Lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak afternoon, one of his neighbors had some news. "'Ohmigod, John, you are in big trouble!' my neighbor tells me. 'Sixty police, federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house, kicked down the door, cut locks off your gun safe.' I couldn't believe it. Then I walked inside. What a nightmare." It was no nightmare; it was horribly real life. Apparently acting on information the Lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm, some thirty agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) teamed up with state and Tulsa police authorities, search warrant in hand, to search for a "Colt, AR-15, .223 caliber machine gun, unknown serial number." The warrant, issued by U.S. Magistrate John Leo Wagner, also authorized agents to seize "any tools used in the alteration or modification of firearms, such as files or drills; documents, papers, books, records, and other tangible properties which identify occupants or owners of the property to be searched...." Reports vary, but according to neighbors, the joint task force operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital involved some 60 agents and local law enforcement personnel against Lawmaster. They cordoned off the street; took station with weapons drawn in the back yard; used a battering ram to break through the front door; kicked in the back door; broke into his gun safe; threw personal papers around the house; spilled boxes of ammunition on the floor; broke into a small, locked box that contained precious coins; stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles, breaking the table in the process. Then, they left. The doors were closed but not latched, much less locked. The ammo and guns were left unsecured. "My front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted through and couldn't latch. Anybody could have waltzed in there and stolen everything I own. A child could have taken a gun. The guns, the safe -- everything was open and laying around. I keep all my magazines empty, but someone had loaded them. While I was looking around in amazement, the gas, electric and water companies show up to turn the power off. They said they were told to shut things down. Then I found the note. "Nothing Found - ATF." "They didn't make any attempt to notify me. I've lived in Tulsa all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket. How come they can't look that up, realize I've been law-abiding my whole life, then come to the door when I'm home? They didn't leave someone here to watch over my private property. They didn't even come by to explain what happened. They just raided my home, ransaked it, left it wide open and left." Lawmaster placed a phone call to the local BATF agent. "I asked, 'Are you gonna' arrest me?' and he said, 'No.' I asken him, "Who is going to repair and clean up my house?' And he said, "If you're going to talk to me, come down to my office.' "'I can't come down!' I said. 'My doors are broken!' If I had been on vacation and I didn't have friendly neighbors, I would have lost everything I own. Here I am a competent, responsible firearms owner, and the government leaves them open, unlocked, with ammo strewn around." Lawmaster said the agent advised him, "If you want your door to lock and your gun safe to lock, you're gonna' have to pay for it yourself." "'Oh, I'll come right down, alright,' I told him. 'I'll come down, but I'll bring my attorney.' And he said, 'Well, you bring your attorney, and we won't talk to you.'" So if you don't want your tea party to be held in awkward silence, make sure your lawyer isn't there, there's a good chap. > It's very sad all those people died, especially the kids, but that's going > to happen in a free society whenever psychologically needy people hook up > with a charismatic nutcase.

Janus, Ph.D. and Cynthia L. Janus, M.D., John Wiley & Sons (pub), 1992) has the following: Table 3.14 Have you ever had a homosexual experience? Men. Women. N= 1,335 1,384 Yes 22% 17% No 78% 83% Table 3.15 How often have you had homosexual contact? Men Women N= 294 235 a. Once 5% 6% b. Occasionally 56% 67% c. Frequently 13% 6% d. Ongoing 26% 21% Active (c. + d.) 39% 37% 39% of 22% is 9%. This number is consistent with Kinsey, Pomery, Gebard (1953), Bell & Weinberg (1967, 1974), and Rice (1987) in the finding that 9% of the male population is actively homosexual, with an further breakdown (Bell & Wienberg, 1978) of 4% exclusively so and 5% self-identifying themselves as "bisexuals." (pp 69, 70) As for debunking Kinsey, the following article is an important lesson for everyone to read: Was Kinsey a Fake and a Pervert? by Philip Nobile Far out on the grassy knoll of sexology, there is a cult of prochastity researchers who claim that the late Alfred Kinsey was a secret sex criminal, a Hoosier Dr. Mengele, who bent his numbers toward the bisexual and the bizarre in a grand conspiracy to queer the nation and usher in an era of free sex with kids. But what really riles these critics is Kinsey's towerin~ cultural influence. His bestselling surveys-- Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953)-- tore the sheets off the country's erogenous zones and undermined midcentury morals. His charts and graphs, based on detailed histories of 12,000 men and women, demonstrated that practices generally considered rare and/or 'abnormal'-- masturbation, extramarital relations, homosexuality, and even barnyard bestiality, were as American as strawberry shortcake. Yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists, aided and abetted by Pat Buchanan and the religious right, the zoology professor from Indiana University remains the evil genius behind the sex revolution and a target for character assassination. Judith Reisman, the prosecution's expert witness at the Mapplethorpe trial in Cincinnati, is the leader of the anti- Kinsey revisionists as well as his Inspector Javert. In 1983, during a radio interview with Pat Buchanan in Washington, Reisman accused Kinsey of having been inolved in "the vicious genital torture of hundreds of children." She speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys in order to carry out clandestine orgasm tests. Now, seven years later, Reisman has revived her charges in a different book, titled Kinsey, Sex and Fraud, just released by the small and religiously oriented Huntington House in Lafayette, Louisiana. Her coauthor is Ed Eichel, a Manhattan psychotherapist who has invented a new style of intromission ("the coital alignment technique") that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm with considerable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between the sexes. In the book Eichel contends that "Kinsey deliberately cooked the gay stats because, being an oddball himself, he wanted to advance the 'denormalization' of heterosexuality." If the authors are right, then the world- famous Kinsey Reports are, as the introduction boldly asserts, "the most egregious example of scientific deception in this century." And if they are wrong, Kinsey, Sex and Fraud is a shameful smear. Despite the less- than- stellar credentials of Kinsey's detractors, legends are not what they used to be. Martin Luther King may have committed plagiarism. Bruno Bettelheim slapped young mental patients around. Father Bruce Ritter, the founder of Covenant House, preyed on runaway boys. Closer to Kinsey, Masters and Johnson have been disgraced for faking it in one way or another. So it should not surprise anybody that Kinsey, who filmed strange people having sex in his attic, may have had skeletons in the closet. The problem is that Reisman does not seem to have the intellectual prowess to pull off the job. As a thinker, the woman is no Madame Curie. The 55-year-old former songwriter for Captain Kangaroo has little professional standing, no current university position, and no peer-review publications, though her creative 1983 resume was padded with phantom accomplishments. For instance, it listed a book as her own-- Take Back the Night: Women on Pornography-- that was actually written and edited by others. Then there is her Ph.D. in Speech Communication from Cleveland's Case Western Reserve University. Although Reisman has no bachelor's degree, Case granted her a master's in 1976 and a doctorate in 1979. Her dissertation was on the commentaries of a local octagenarian TV commentator. But on the resume, Reisman gave this piece of scholarship a fancy Hautes Etudes moniker-- to wit: "The Application of Aristotelian and Systems Analytic Theory to Mass Media Effects." When Reisman burst into prominence on Buchanan's program, it was love at first sight for Al Regnery, the outwardly anti- porn head of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in Ed Meese's Justice Department. Regnery was a young law-and-order conservative and amateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexual climate of the United States. After Reisman's sensational radio session, the sexual equivalent of Joe McCarthy's Wheeling speech, Regnery summoned her to meetings to discuss mutual interests. First he tried to shovel her $800,000 for a quasi-Frankenstein study that was going to measure the brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousing photographs. Guffaws on Capitol Hill killed the original proposal, but $734,000 in govemment money went to Reisman anyway for plan B- a probe of child images in the cartoons Playboy, Penthouse, and Hust ler. (Incredibly, this grant surpassed the entire budget of the attorney general's pornography commission.) When the overpriced and oversold project was completed in 1986, it was immediately shelved by an embarrassed Justice Department. That spring, Regnery resigned from his post only days before the New Republic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazines around the house. Notwithstanding the six-figure humiliation, Reisman went on to scratch out a niche on the ioony right. As the darling of the sex cranks, she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia in men's magazines and blames AIDS on gays. Kinsey, Sex and Fraud is Reisman's latest grasp for respectability. Pat Buchanan, of course, is putting his Krugerrands on Reisman's ultimate vindication. "This book is social dynamite," he says in a blurb an the front cover. He especially liked the antigay parts. Smacking his lips in his syndicated column, he declared, "It may just blow the sewer cap off Kinsey's monumental reputation, reestablish homosexuality as a 1-in-50 aberration, expose the Gay Rights movement as a paper tiger, and even put at risk the enormous sex industry built upon Dr. Kinsey's 'research.'" The blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered and repetilive j'Accuse is that Kinsey was a sex-mad pedophile who molested little boys in Nazi-type experiments and recorded their orgasms in his male volume/ A similar charge was first recited at the Fifth World Conference on Sexology in Jerusalem in 1981 to no effect before being recycled by Reisman for Buchanan in Washington in 1983. Here is how Reisman and Eichel repackaged the Mengele business in Kinsey, Sex and Fraud: Mengele-like 'scientific' experiments on infants and children were the basis for Kinsey's conclusions... on childhood sexuality. Somewhere and sometime in the course of the project, Kinsey appears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundred children aged from two months to almost 15 years. This, of course, would implicate Kinsey and his team in promoting, and perhaps participating in, the criminal activity. In the opinion of this book's authors, that is exactly how part of Kinsey's child sexuality research took place. Donning his psychohistorian's cap and citing an FBI manual on child molesters as a guide, Eichel casually diagnoses Kinsey as a homosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly as Reisman said: [Kinsey] placed himself in professional and nonprofessional positions where he had access to young boys, such as Y.M.C.A. camp counselor, boys' club leader, and Boy Scout leader-- activities he kept up 'during his college and graduate yeaers, and even after his marriage." As crude as his analysis seems, Eichel was more than happy to elaborate even further in a recent phone interview. "If you've ever been around boy- lovers, pedophiles, they are absolutely compulsive," he averred. "Everything in his life is directed at getting children. I didn't mention this in our book but the caption under Kinsey's high school picture was a quote from Hamlet: 'Man delights me not, no, [sic] nor woman neither.' What do you think they were picking up on?" Before weighing what Reisman and Eichel pass off as proof of Kinsey's sex crimes, something must be said about Kinsey's scientific modus operandi. He was a fiendish collector. As a young zoologist with a D.Sc. from Harvard, he collected 4 million gall wasps and 1.5 million related insects. When he switched to sex exploration after agreeing to teach a marriage Course at Indiana University in 1938, he was no less curious or acquisitive. Nothing that mammals did in the realm of reproduction was foreign to him. He compiled masses of erotic materials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and female johns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms of mating in 14 species of animals that showed an amazing similarity in oral eroticism. Naturally, the sexual response of children, the genesis of eros, fascinated him. It was impossible to understand the sexual behaviors of adults without examining their origins. And so with the fervor of his bughunting days, Kinsey collected information about kids, though even his worst enemies-- until Reisman and Eichel-- refrained from linking him personally to his data on preadolescent sex. Kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information on the sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them: "Some of these adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries or other records which have been put at our disposal." Although he gathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and the observations of parents and nursery school teachers, he treated the documentary materia! of the pedophiles as pure gold. There was nothing like it in the literature. Kinsey's main source, a 63-year-old govemment worker, was also the most unforgettable character he had ever met. This man, whose history took 17 hours to log, had sex with over 600 boys and 200 girls as well as 17 of 33 family members including his father and grandmother. A sexual hobbyist and passionate record-keeper, he gave Kinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescent boys. Relying on the man's meticulous research, which involved following some boys for as long as 16 years, Kinsey was able to identify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm-- some of which involved violent contortions at the peak of release-- as well as the speed and the capacity of climax. What Freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality, Kinsey had reported as fact. Children were indeed erotic beings from the cradle. "These data on the sexual activities of younger male provide an important substantiation of the Freudian view of sexuality as a component that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy," he concluded without raising eyebrows in 1948. Then along came Judith Reisman. Ignorng the legitimacy of Kinsey's inquiry, she beheld the ghost of Mengele in Bloomington. She was appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the portrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government worker. And she dared to say that Kinsey was a sex criminal. Well, was he or wasn't he? Let's go to the text. There is no evidence in Kinsey, Sex and Fraud-- no witnesses, no paper, noteven a trace of hearsay-- that implicates Kinsey in either planning or partaking in child sex experiments. After 12 years on the trail, Reisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge- - amazingly enough, Kinsey himself and Wardell Pomeroy, Kinsey's coauthor on both reports, to whom Reisman has never spoken. It turns out that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volume iand in Pomeroy's 1972 biography titled Dr. Kinsey and the Institute for Sex Research. After frisking every "the" and "and" in both books, Reisman came up with what she believes are "smoking" sentences. To establish Kinsey's alleged role in the planning, she says that "there is a hint" in the fifth chapter of the male volume that Kinsey "directed" the orgasm studies on kids. She cites his tell-tale quote from a critic of armchair psychoanalysis demanding that "writers...test their theories...by empirical study and statistical procedures." Then she combines this quote with Kinsey's statement that some of the observations of his pedophile sources "were continued over periods of months or years until the individuals were old enough to make it certain that true orgasm was involved." Putting two and two together-- Kinsey's empiricism and lengthy experimentation-- she arrives at her hint. But realizing this dog would not hunt, she devoted but a single paragraph to Kinsey's supposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personal involvement. As for the alleged participation, after poring over Pomeroy's biography, Reisman found several hidden clues suggesting Kinsey's likely hands-on approach to kiddie sex. Here the chain of reasoning is more complex. She points out that Kinsey was interested in clitoral measurements, collecting sperm and filming sex in his attic. Since Kinsey did indeed mislead Indiana University about the purpose of his cinematography-- he said that he was filming "animal sex"-- Reisman asserts that a "similar misrepresentation may yet apply to Kinsey's child sex experiments." Catch the "may"! Reisman was also struck by Kinsey's doubting Thomas attitude toward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits: "Kinsey, according to Pomeroy, was the type of person who needed to see things for himself. Pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female rabbit. Because he had not personally witnessed this event, Kinsey had difficulty in accepting its reality, even on the strength of testimony from a distinguished scientist. How then did Kinsey testify to the actuality of orgasm in a 5-month-old infant from the mere 'history' of a sex offender?" (But, of course, he did not: he depended on their records.) From this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides, sperm, attic cumshots, and climax-in-cottontail has Reisman defamed the legendary Kinsey. Paul Gebhard succeeded Kinsey as the director of the Kinsey Institute and now lives in retirement outside Bloomington. Reached by telephone, Gebhard defended the pedophile connection and denied Reisman's nasty imputations. "I don't understand the resistance of people like Reisman to studying the sexuality of children," Gebhard said more in exasperation than anger. "That is where sex begins. We were happy to take data wherever we found it. Even though pedophiles commit criminal acts, they are usually not violent folks. They wouldn't be very successful if they were. One of our best sources was a headmaster of a boys' school who maintained a kind of alumni club and sometimes went to the weddings of his former students. As for directing experiments, that's absurd. We never told any of our subjects what to do. lt was against our principles. Almost all of the pedophile material was retrospective anyway. Nor did we ever conduct sex experiments with children ourselves. That would have been highly inappropriate." I asked Gebhard if Kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexual situation. "I think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped her teddy bear and Kinsey watched it." As for Kinsey's sex life, it is still shrouded in confidentiality. He was married to the same woman for 35 years and fathered four children. Apparently, there are no huge sexual revelations, although rumors of homosexuality have persisted without confirmation through the years. Gebhard took his boss's history back in the '40s, but he refuses to discuss what he knows. "We never divulge anything about anybody's history, whether dead or alive," he says. Reisman said no to an interview for this article on the grounds that I had once worked for Penthouse-- not to mention the fact that we have been debating each other in various forums for the past five years. In keeping with our contentious history, she took a swipe at me in her book for continuing "the Kinsey practice of euphemizing incest." My offense was using the biblical variant "lying with a near relative" in a 1977 article on the subject of incest. As a synonym for intercourse, "lying with" appears eight times in Genesis. Ed Eichel is a different story. Though seemingly obsessed by Kinsey like his coauthor, he was friendly in long conversations. He told me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when he was a student in New York University's Human Sexuality program in the early '80s. "It was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals," he says. Around 1985, Eichel came upon Reisman's critique of Kinsey and the conspiracy theory started to sink in: the sex establishment was ruled by a Kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of the heterosexual norm. No wonder he was having such a rough time promoting the joy of simultaneous orgasm-- anything that enhanced sexual compatibility between men and women inevitably raised objections. Eventually, Eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with Reisman, and from this union Kinsey, Sex and Fraud was born. Eichel's main contribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a Kinsey conspiracy that supposedly seeks "the establishment of bisexuality as the balanced sexual orientation for normal, uninhibited people" which, by destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexual behavior, "would open the way for the second and more difficult step-- the ultimate goal of cross-generational sex (sex with children)." When I pressed him for specific references to back up his outrageous contentions, he said weakly, "You don't think Kinsey is going to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexual and should have sex with kids, but this is implicit in the Kinsey reports." Meanwhile, Eichel is demanding a congressional investigation of Kinsey and his data. Perfect. That's just what the country needs-- a House Un-American Sexual Activities Committee, looking under beds and asking people if they are now or have everbeen a reader, a sympathizer or-- God forbid-- a subject of Dr. Alfred Kinsey.

No, it is optional ... as it is optional for doctors to accept it.

I actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since WW I ... no, scratch that ... there are a few in Western Canada, and *quite* a few in Quebec as part of the post-1980 Quebec Miracle (out with the nationalism, in with the French capitalism). La Groupe des Cooper- antes built a new tower by the Eaton('s) store at Les Terraces, and if you were able to catch Urban Angel on CBS's Crimetime you'd see it as the well-lit one with double-turrets at the top. As for Ontario, which still dominates and anchors business up north ... Canada is a very old-money kind of place, and the 1989 Free Trade Agreement saw a lot of odd alliances: labour unions and establishment old money who wanted to preserve their traditional monopolies on one side, and entrepreneurs and internationally oriented businesses and professionals on the other. The final Trudeau administration and the first Mulroney government had a high percentage of nouveaux riches who knew what it was like to make your own money, and that motivated the McDonald Commission under Trudeau which set up Brian's initiative (Macaroni was against free trade 'til he did a head count of his caucus after the 1984 election). >It's not really insurance if you don't have alternatives Well, you have to realize that in our society that's like saying that "it's not really national defence" because you can't hire your own Rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist. (BTW, there are always pacifists in the news arguing about their portion of taxes, but never people arguing over health insurance alternatives ... and we're talking about a press that is hostile to whomever is in government, regardless of party; one of their few redeeming characteristics, it seems (-;). >Also, in the April 14 Globe and Mail, there was a letter from the >director of trauma services at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto >responding to an article on a study comparing heart surgery in >California and Canada in which some Canadian doctor worried that >American analysts would seize on the results as proof that Canada >rationed vital services. The doctor (I can't recall his name) said >that Canada *is* rationing vital services "as any physician can >plainly see". He said that a system in which people are refused >treatment because they can't afford it is no different from a system >in which people are refused treatment because the government can't >afford it as a result of deliberate underfunding of the health >insurance plan. In fairness, he did say that both the US and >Canadian systems are in the same situation. The only way to hit at the Canadian system is transient periods of high demand, which is more a function of the doctors monopoly's tight fist on the licencing. An obvious difference is that in such a transient period, the rationing is of the nature of a mob battling over Cabbage Patch Dolls^TM as we've seen recently as opposed by rationing by ability to pay ... but the former is a *transient* situation and if a large body of insured patients were to deluge the California health infrastructure, the same would result --- rationing among the insured population. With smaller markets, there is much less flexibility when dealing with our insured population than California (which by the way, has 1/3rd more people than Canada in a MUCH more dense area). So he is correct in that the resources are fixed (for a particular time window, or as a function of the doctors monopoly licencing according to the market steady state) in either case. As for being "refused treatment" the government of the day would be shredded to tatters if something like that were to happen; Canadians can be geographically bad, too, not realizing that their health care is private while only their insurance isn't ... too many people have bought into socialist trype that we have socialized medicine. >I know, I know, the monopoly power of Canadian doctors often leads >them to overstate the problems with the system in order to get more >money from the government (another case of businessmen, once >scratched, becoming socialists). Right, as I've pointed out above ... >But hasn't that just shifted the locus of the problem from one place >to the other? It hasn't really solved it. Either way, the transient situations are hard to deal with since the changes in the private medical care resource take place at a slower rate than the ability of people to fall sick esp. in the light of disasters (e.g., Chernobyl) or bad luck (a sudden wave of heart disease). A doctor needs 4-6 years of training, plus internship and specialty training. >People too often tend to put prescription cold medicine on their >insurance when they really don't need to. That's why I've argued for deductible and copayments rather than education, which is what most Canadian fiscal conservatives are arguing for (the leftists?

Also, note that only a few provinces cover prescriptions under some high dollar threshold ... in most, it's your private insurance that covers it just like in the U.S. Still, it all adds up in the OECD measures. >In fact, Buffalo may be the only place in the US where people >get Don Cherry jokes (:-).

The medical IRA would have limited use, as you'd need a lower catastrophic threshold else there'd still be a drain on the public purse if someone exhausts their IRA.

It's about time! I've ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they don't invest in their own private practices ... in the end, it's their money. But they choose to spend it on America's Cup pipedreams, and that's none of my business. As for "provincially owned" ... for sure it's against the law in Canada for governments to be directly involved in the provision of health care except in the military or native reser- vations. What that term actually means is that the facility gets by on public grants to meet shortfall from *lack of use* ... no kidding. Medical practice itself is much more conservative up north. My own best friend did two clerkships at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, and is no stranger to high tech medicine ... but his boat comes first. >There were some people expressing concern that it was the first wedge of >two-tiered health care and that it might violate the Canada Health Act. No, it's probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have private practices ... and always have. They can all take cash anyways ... so why not have a particular facility? The Canadian big government mentality often imagines government where it does not even exist ... Since the French and Germans have become more entrepreneurial and less laidback without sacrificing their culture and values, then Canadians can do the same. As I've pointed out above, the law states that it is illegal for the *government* to provide any health services except for the military and natives. Look, nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the MRI ... nobody stopped them when they bought it. Nobody seems to be stopping them from using it, either. Much ado about nothing.

I'm certain there is exaggeration somewhere, because the GAO study of Canada cited often on USENET did not find access to MRI to be a problem. I'll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened to American trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit.

To borrow Money [...] 3. To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, [interstate and Indian tribes] 4. To [do uniform Naturalization and Bankruptcies] 5. To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and [etc.] 6. To [punish counterfeiters] 7. To establish Post Offices and post Roads 8. To [provide patents and copyrights] 9. To constitute Tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court; 10. To define and punish Piracies and [etc.] 11. To declare War, [and etc.] 12. To raise and support Armies,[but for no longer than two years at a stretch] 13. To provide and maintain a Navy, [notice no time limit on this one] 14. To [make the rules for the army and navy] 15. To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws [etc.] 16. To provide for [training of the army except for some state stuff] 17. To exercise exclusive Legislation [in D.C] 18.

Before, the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) were just Members of National Parliaments (MNPs) elected by and from among their peers. In the European Parliament, every Member State has a fixed number of seats, which increases less than proportionally with the population. Once in five years, a general European election is being held, in which the citizens of all Member States choose their representatives to the European Parliament. Next elections are due in 1994. Now the voting system for these European elections still differs from one country to another. Although the European Treaty enabling the direct election of the MEPs requires a uniform voting system, up to now every country has just used its own system, more or less the same one used for national elections. British MEPs are elected in a first-past-the-post system with one MEP per district; nearly all other States have chosen a system with proportional representation. But then in some countries (France, Italy) MEPs are allowed to be a MNP as well, whilst in others they are not (Belgium, Netherlands). The European Parliament is now working on a uniform election system for its own members, so that every candidate should have the same regulations to comply with, regardless of the Member State (s)he wants to be elected for. I would like to know what you people out there think of the following questions: 1. Do you think it is necessary to have uniform regulations or should every Member State continue to use its own regulations (for European elections that is)? 2. Do you think a system of majority voting should be implemented, with one or more MEPs per district, or would you prefer a system with proportional representation (for the whole of the Community or per state, per region, per district?). 3. Do you think the European Commission (or just its president) should be directly elected too, or should it be appointed by the European Parliament, or by the joint Member State governments as it is now? 4. The Maastricht Treaty allows subjects of Member States to stand for election in another Member State they are residing in. Do you think you would or could vote for a foreigner if his/her ideas appeal to you? 5. Do you think MEPs should be allowed to be a member of a national parliament or a regional parliament too? Or a member of a national or regional government body? 6. The European Parliament now has meetings in both Strasbourg and Brussels. MEPs themselves are for a complete move to Brussels in great majority, but political compromises between the governments of the Member States stick to the status quo. Do you approve of this or do you think the European Parliament should meet in one city only, and if yes, which? Please post your answers to eunet.politics, to which all followups are automatically directed. If you do not have access to that group, please mail your answer directly to me and I will post it for you.

What *exactly* does the American Constitution say about "the right to association" ? Homosexuals, whether Clayton likes it or not, are as much members of society as he is. As such they have the right to participate and have an equal opportunity to pursue their goals. No-one is saying that Clayton should be forced to associate with queerfolk in his private life (one suspects the gays in question would object also 8-) ), but by proclaiming the general right not to associate with them in the *public* sphere (which includes housing, hiring, etc), he's giving his right to non-association priority over their rights to equal access to opportunity. Historically, people can associate publically with disliked groups with very little ill-effect, however cutting a group off from normal commerce has a severe impact on their lives. Clayton, why exactly should your "right" to non-association in the public sphere take priority over homosexual's rights to equal opportunity ? -- Tony Quirke, Wellington, New Zealand.

Practically every time the defense tried to get the plaintiffs to "self-incriminate" by asking them such questions, there were objections and sustains. At one point the defense managed to get in a quip about "solicitation for a felony" and the judge herself said "sustained" before the prosecutor could get the objection stated. -- G.

"Barter economy" means that drug users will be permitted to grow or synthesize chemically anything they choose, or to buy it outside the U.S. and bring it in, if it won't grow here. They will also be permitted to trade with other drug users for drugs other than the ones they themselves grow or manufacture. They will not, however be able to legally sell their drugs for money. Both manufacture and importation of noncommercial drugs will be taxed, to discourage their use. "This is your brain on drugs. Any questions?" > |3.

You cannot analogize the rates at which drug users would seek treatment, and the comparative ease with which it could be made available today, when these drugs are illegal to possess/use, with what it would be were they_not_illegal to possess/use. Decriminalizing possession and use makes treatment_much_easier. Drug dealers are exploiting the weaknesses of those persons who are prone to addiction, and as such, the drug users should be left alone, not thrown in prison along with their victimizers. Drug_dealers_are the criminals, and should be treated as such. Drug addiction does not absolve you of responsiblity for your criminal actions, however. > |4.

The drug test of an arrested suspect is voluntary, not coerced, and does not therefore constitute violation of Amendment V. Those convicted who are drug users, as evidenced by the test, are in need of treatment for their problem. Institutionalization of these adddicted criminals is, I would argue, the best way to help them straighten out. If they refuse the test and are convicted, their sentence can be appropriately harsher, since they, unlike the addict, have no "excuse" for their crimes. > |5.

My objective is to discourage drug use_and_criminal behavior. If fewer criminals do drugs out of fear of getting a harsher sentence if they are convicted, why is that not a good thing? If fewer drug dealers (who are still criminals, BTW) can find victims, why is that not a good thing? If fewer drug users, such as drunks, 'potheads,' etc., commit crimes out of fear of being cut off from their sources of supply, why is that not a good thing? I'm certainly willing to debate my position.

Non-toxic tear gas?!? Do you know what tear gas is? I do: once upon a time I happened to be in a room when someone threw a tear-gas grenade in (that was supposed to be a joke:). The sensation was incredible: I felt my eyes and nostrils were being torn apart. I remember us - a bunch of young men in our early 20's - running out like a herd of wild animals, knocking down the door and jumping out of the windows (thank G-d we were on the first floor). I can't imagine this kind of stuff being used against children. For them, the worst effect might not be the physical effects so much as the psychological effect of being incapacitated without fully understanding the cause. Many years ago, I was accidentally exposed to a tiny dose of tear gas. (It was in Athens, on the street leading to the American Embassy; there'd been a march that had been broken up with tear-gas; I must have stumbled into a remaining patch of gas the next day.) Aside from the tears, feeling sick to my stomach, etc., the really horrible psychological effect was that of suddenly falling to pieces and not knowing why it had happened---I was horrified and wondered what disease or other health problem I had. (I didn't find out about the march and the tear-gas till hours later.) I can imagine how horribly disorienting this might be to very young children: suddenly crying uncontrollably and feeling sick, weak, and out of control of your body---and not knowing the cause. ``This gives us a chance to try the Gas of Peace.''

When the sheriff came to arrest him, the sheriff knocked on the dorr and showed Koresh the warrant (a tactic that the BATF might try learning). Koresh and the others charged peacibly surrendered to the sherrif.

Furthermore, the background emmisions of chlorine compounds into the atmoshpere is about 0.6 ppb annually, it now sits at 3.5.

THANK you for playing, but obviously you are not reading the material as it is presented. According to the report I've got in my hands, the Newsweek article (which reported that "2 to 3 percent" of the population is gay) used the criteria of "No heterosexual contact in the past year." But at the same time, the University of Denver study points out, quite dramatically, that 60% of all self-identifying gay men have > had some form of heterosexual contact in the past year. I think the big mistake in that study must be that if one had had no sexual contact of any kind in the previous year, they are counted as heterosexual. Even if they didn't intend it that way, that's how the figures are being used.	2

I find it very interesting that you say there will be 2.5 million queers in the march on Washington. The largest figure I've seen in the press is 1 million and we all know how liberal the press is with their numbers. :) For another thing, 1% of 250 million is 2.5 million not 6. Maybe that's where you got the 2.5 million number. Also, the number cited in the actual report is 1.5% so that would be about 3.75 million. As for this march on Washington, I wonder how much the media is going to inflate the numbers this time. Last time, for the pro-abortion rally, they more than doubled the actual number of people who showed up. That and all the stories coming out of how the press "slants" the news really makes one wonder who's watching the watchers.

If you were to walk up to black person to talk about blacks in the inner city and began the conversation with "Those niggers in th.......". You would lose the attention of that black person by the time you spoke your second word. All name calling and derisive remarks do is turn off the audience you are trying to address.

155	From: techie@cellar.org (William A Bacon) Subject: some scientists do not believe in the green house effect Organization: The Cellar BBS and public access system Lines: 93 The following statement was released on February 27,1992 by the Science & Environmental Policy Project As independent scientists researching atmosphere and climate problems, we are concerned by the agenda for UNCED, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, being developed by environmental and activists groups and certain political leaders. This so called "Earth Summit" is scheduled to convene in Brazil in June 1992 and aims to impose a system of global envionmental regulations, including onerous taxes on energy fuels, on the population of the United States and other industrialized nations. Such policy initiatives derive from highly uncetain scientific theories. They are based on the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossill fuels and requires immediate action. We do not agree. A survey of U.S. Atmospheric scientists, conducted in the summer of 1991, confirms that there is no consesensus about the cause of the slight warming observed during the past century. A recently published research paper even suggests sunspot variability (which is directly proportional to solar activity), rather than a rise in greenhouse gases is responsible for the global temperature increases and decreases recoded since about 1880. Futhermore, the majority of scientific participants in the survey agreed that the theoretical climate climate models used to predict a future warming cannot be relied upon and are not validated by the existing climate record. Yet all predictions are based on such theoretical models. Finally, agriculturalits generally agree that any increase in carbon dioxide levels from fossil fuels burning has beneficial effects on most crops and on world food supply. We are disturbed that activists, anxious to stop energy and economic growth, are pushing ahead with drastic policies without taking notice of recent changes in the underlying science. We fear that the rush to impose global regulations will have catastrophic impacts on the world economy, on jobs, standards of living, and health care, with the most severe consequences falling on developing countries and the poor.

156	From: Clinton-HQ@Campaign92.Org (The White House) Subject: CLINTON: AM Press Briefing by Dee Dee Myers 4.20.93 Organization: MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab Lines: 693 NNTP-Posting-Host: life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 20, 1993 PRESS BRIEFING BY DEE DEE MYERS The Briefing Room 9:47 A.M. EDT MS. MYERS: Okay, today's schedule. As you know, the President jogged this morning with Senator Wofford. At 1:15 p.m., he will have a photo opportunity in the Rose Garden to present the Teacher of the Year Award. At 1:30 p.m., he will meet with his principal advisors on Bosnia. And at 5:00 p.m., he'll meet with President Vaclav Havel. There will be a photo op at the top of that meeting; no formal press conference afterwards. Any questions? Q Is he moving towards some major decision this week on Bosnia? MS. MYERS: As we've said, he's continuing to discuss his options. He's been talking extensively with his foreign policy advisors, his Bosnia advisors, as well as with other world leaders. He'll try to contact President Mitterrand again today, and he'll continue to discuss it. We don't have any specific timetable, but obviously the situation there is very serious. Q Has he called Janet Reno today or yesterday? MS. MYERS: I don't believe he's spoken to her today. Q Why does he have nothing to say about this publicly except on the piece of paper that was put out last night at 6:40 p.m.? MS. MYERS: He did. He answered a question about it yesterday. Q Before anything had happened. MS. MYERS: Before anything happened. He put out -- Q Since something has happened he's had nothing to say. MS. MYERS: He's put out a statement on it last night. And we'll have more to say about it later today. Q In what forum is that going to be? MS. MYERS: It will be at the photo in the Rose Garden. Q He will talk about Waco at that? MS. MYERS: Yes, he'll have something to say. Q Is that something we can take live? MS. MYERS: I think it will be brief. We can talk a little later about the exact structure as we work it out. But I don't know if it's something you'd want to take live. Q Will he take questions on Waco at that time as well? MS. MYERS: He'll probably take a few. Q Is there any reason why he hasn't talked to the Attorney General? MS. MYERS: I'll have to double-check. I don't know that he hasn't talked to her this morning. Q And she didn't come here this morning to see him or anyone else? MS. MYERS: No. Q And he didn't talk yesterday? Q What's the reaction to her resignation statement that she made last night? MS. MYERS: She was asked a question about it, and she answered the question. The President has absolutely no intention of asking for the Attorney General's resignation. He stands behind her 100 percent. As you know, he was informed about the decision. He takes full responsibility for that, and stands 100 percent behind Attorney General Reno. Q The question now arises -- yesterday we were told that he was briefed on this, but we never got a firm idea of how much he knew of what the plan was and the justification for the plan and the justification of the timing. Was he fully informed on all of that, all of this about the increasing levels of violence inside the compound that made them want to go now, the feeling that nothing else was going to succeed, et cetera? MS. MYERS: He talked with the Attorney General about the decision, about -- she talked to him about the factors that led to her decision. He raised no objections. He supports her decision to go forward with it. He was fully briefed. Q Of course, hindsight is 20-20, but looking back now, does the President, does the White House feel that the decision he signed off on proved to be the right way to go when you look at what actually happened? MS. MYERS: I think everybody feels bad when life is lost. But I don't think that that is reason to second-guess the decision. He stands behind the decision that was made. He was informed about it. He was fully briefed about it and he stands 100 percent behind the Attorney General, the Justice Department and the FBI. It's a difficult operation and there's -- it had already gone on for more than seven weeks. Four federal agents had lost their lives in the line of duty -- let's not forget that. This was a very difficult situation and all the decisions involved were very difficult. But all the agents on the ground, the FBI, the Justice Department all recommended moving forward with this. They thought, given the circumstances, it was the best possible course of action. There's just no point in second- guessing those decisions. Now, I think that there's a reason -- Q Why not? They have to -- MS. MYERS: No, not to second-guess the decisions. I think it's important to take a look at it, to have an investigation. I think the President will talk some about that later today. But at this -- from this vantage point, to second-guess those decisions, it's not useful. Q You sound like he's going to order an investigation of what happened and whether -- MS. MYERS: I think he'll have more to say about that later, yes. Q He will order an investigation? MS. MYERS: He'll have more -- yes -- he'll have more to say about an investigation. Q What kind of investigation? MS. MYERS: He'll have more to say about it later. Q But in the Monday morning quarterbacking, surely there is some soul-searching now as to whether it was the right decision. You can't say that we did the best we could when it turned out to be a rather -- a debacle. MS. MYERS: I think we'll -- obviously, we'll review the situation and all the factors that lead to a very tragic outcome. I don't think anybody disputes that the outcome was tragic. But, again, the President stands behind the decisions that were made and we'll take a look at the factors that contributed to that. Q What was the FBI Director's role in this? MS. MYERS: Well, he was obviously involved in setting up the operation. He signed off on it, as did the agents that were on the ground that were working with him. I don't believe he spoke to the President, but I'll double-check that. Q But he was very closely involved in every aspect of planning and so forth? MS. MYERS: I would refer you to the FBI on exactly what aspects he was involved with. Q Will Janet Reno be coming over to the White House today? MS. MYERS: There's no planned meeting. I don't believe that she'll be here. Q She won't be at this event at 1:15 p.m.? MS. MYERS: No, no plans to be. Q Do you think that there's going to be a jumping on on the part of political opposition to make something out of this in terms of -- to the President's detriment politically? MS. MYERS: Well, I would certainly hope that people wouldn't try to use this tragedy for political reasons. Obviously, I think, again, that it's useful to look at the facts, to reevaluate the facts, and I think the President will move forward with that. But I think people understand that this was a difficult series of decisions; that it was a very difficult situation; that it was caused by a man who was a cult leader who was involved in the death of four federal agents. And I think it's most tragic that a lot of innocent children lost their lives in this. I don't think anybody disputes the tragedy of the outcome. Q Dee Dee, what was the White House role in handling the, I guess, public relations aspect in the aftermath? Who was talking -- who here at the White House was talking with people at Justice to set up Reno's news conference, to do all that sort of thing? MS. MYERS: I think the Attorney General handled her end of the situation herself and made the decision to go ahead with the news conference once there was a point at which there was enough information, I think, to talk with some accuracy about what had transpired during the day. Obviously, people here at a number of levels were keeping in touch with people at the Justice Department and at the FBI to try to keep informed about what was happening there. Q But Reno said that she didn't talk to the President, and there seemed to be an indication she hadn't talked to anybody at the White House. So who -- MS. MYERS: There were people talking on a staff-to- staff level. Q I understand. But who at the Justice Department was handling that for Reno? Who was talking to the White House? MS. MYERS: There were a number of people. As you know, Webb Hubbell is the liaison to the White House, and I know he talked to a number of people here. There were a number of people at a number of different levels involved. I don't want to get into exactly who had what conversations with whom, but there were a number of conversations. Obviously, the Justice Department was working to keep the White House informed, the press informed to the best of its ability as events unfolded throughout the day. Q Did Webb Hubbell talk to the President? MS. MYERS: I don't believe so. I don't know if he talked -- he may have at one point. Q And was the White House role just to seek information about what happened, or was it to direct the public information campaign that followed? MS. MYERS: It was both to keep abreast of the situation so the President could be on top of it, but I think the Justice Department managed its press relations on it. We were obviously very interested in what was happening there throughout the day, and the President was following it very closely throughout the day. Q Dee Dee, on that, though, if the President was following it so closely and he had talked the night before with Janet Reno, why wouldn't he talk to her at all since then? MS. MYERS: Again, I don't know if he's talked to her this morning. Again, he's kept fully aware of what has been going on throughout the day. He stands 100 percent behind her decisions. He's been fully supportive of her, as he said yesterday morning before events transpired and yesterday afternoon in a written statement. Q But wouldn't he want to convey those thoughts to her personally yesterday? MS. MYERS: One more time, I don't know if they've spoken this morning. Q No, yesterday. Q Clearly there's a perception that she was left hung out to dry all day yesterday. MS. MYERS: That's just not true. I think we said throughout the day that the President takes full responsibility, that he stands -- I don't know how much clearer we can be. The President stands foursquare behind the Attorney General on this. He accepts full responsibility for the events that transpired. He believes that Janet Reno, the Justice Department, and the FBI acted as best they could, given the circumstances and the facts that were evident at the time. I don't know what else he can say to show that he supports her 1,000 percent. Q One of the best indications of that is to pick up the phone and tell her. MS. MYERS: Again, I don't know whether they've spoken this morning. Q Why can't we find out? MS. MYERS: Well, we can. I can't do it standing here right now. Q You've got six people here. All they've got to do is pick up the phone. MS. MYERS: Helen, we'll get back to you. Q Dee Dee, when the President spoke with the Attorney General on Sunday, is it safe to assume that either she volunteered or he inquired about whether there was a possible downside to increasing pressure on the Davidians? MS. MYERS: I think that they discussed the situation. Again, I'm not going to get into the specific details of what exactly she told him, but I think that he was aware of the risks involved. Q Dee Dee, the President yesterday morning said it was entirely her decision. She then said that she told him what was happening and he said, okay. Does the President regard it that he gave the go-ahead or that she gave the go-ahead? MS. MYERS: I think what they both said yesterday was that she made a decision based on all the available facts. She informed him about that and he raised no objections. Again, I don't know how much clearer we can be about that. Q And he said, okay. The issue is over the responsibility. MS. MYERS: He said, okay. Q Does okay mean -- MS. MYERS: The President accepts ultimate responsibility. Q Dee Dee, the President's investigation that he's going to announce -- would that be conducted by someone outside the administration? MS. MYERS: No. Q It would be internal -- is it meant to preclude any congressional investigation? MS. MYERS: No, it's meant simply to follow up on the incidents that occurred yesterday. Q And you would, I assume, therefore, cooperate fully with any congressional hearings that would be held? MS. MYERS: To the best of our ability. Q Dee Dee, there are two reports out this morning. One that the Justice Department, or FBI, or whomever, apparently had a bug planted inside the complex. And the other is that the children may have been injected with some kind of poison that may have either left them unconscious or maybe even killed them before the fire. What do you know about those two -- MS. MYERS: Nothing more than I've seen in news accounts this morning. We may get more on it later, but at this point, I know -- I'm not sure anybody knows any more than what was reported by people who came out of the compound. Q Has the President received any report today in terms of fatalities and actually what was going on -- what they've been able to find out on in the compound now? MS. MYERS: He's been briefed. I don't think that they've gotten into the compound yet. They were still waiting for it to cool off. I don't think there's much beyond what's been reported in the news accounts. But he has been kept up-to-date on it. Q Dee Dee, the President stands behind Attorney General Reno, but does he feel that she perhaps got bad advice from the so-called experts? MS. MYERS: He believes that she made -- he stands behind the decision that she made. It was the unanimous decision of her advisors, of the FBI, of the agents on the ground, and he supports that. Q What about the validity of the decisions made on the ground? Does he back those -- MS. MYERS: He's not going to second-guess decisions made. Q Dee Dee, you just said, he stands behind the decision which she made. Normally, in a situation like this, the President says, I made the decision. But you're saying she made the decision? MS. MYERS: I'm saying that the President was briefed about the decision. He okayed it and he accepts full responsibility for it. Q But then why do you keep using the terminology, the decision that she made, rather than the decision that he made -- MS. MYERS: Because, as he said yesterday, she evaluated the facts based on evidence presented to her by Justice Department and FBI, which is part of the Justice Department, and made a decision and then briefed the President on that decision. That is how the chain of command works. She briefed him. He signed off on it. The operation went forward, and the President accepts full responsibility. Q In that chain of command analogy there, I want to go back to Sessions a moment. Do you know if this was a plan that came through him to Reno, or was it presented to her around him or with his involvement? What was his involvement? MS. MYERS: Again, you'd have to go to the Justice Department for the specific interaction between the Attorney General and the Director. Q Does the President stand behind Director Sessions? MS. MYERS: He supports -- again, I don't know how many different ways I can say this -- he supports the decisions made by the Justice Department and the FBI. He fully supports the Attorney General in this. I'm not stepping away from the Director of the FBI, I want to -- but Janet Reno is the one who briefed him, the one who made the decisions as the head of the Justice Department. As you know, the Director of the FBI reports to the Attorney General. The Attorney General made the decision. She informed the President about those decisions. He okayed it. He didn't raise any objections to it, and he accepts full responsibility. Q Do you have, based on what you know here at the White House, any concerns about William Sessions' performance during this -- MS. MYERS: Nothing to suggest that, no. Q Along those same lines, just in your initial review of the situation, how much do you think the problems might have come from not having a Justice Department that's fully staffed and having an FBI Director who is still quite uncertain about his status? MS. MYERS: I just don't think that had anything to do with it. I think the agents on the ground -- the operation went forward. I'm not going to speculate on that. Q Did the White House express any alarm that Janet Reno chose to speak to the live network media before she chose to speak to Clinton? MS. MYERS: No. She was carrying forward her responsibility to inform the public about the events of yesterday. I think she did a very admirable job. The President agrees with that. Q Before Sunday, how often was the President briefed on the situation in Waco? MS. MYERS: He was kept updated on a regular basis, on a daily basis. Q Who briefed the President? MS. MYERS: Well, I'm not going to get into exactly who, what conversations he had with whom, but he was kept up-to-date on the events in Waco. He has daily briefings on a number of issues. Q No, no, was this a regular briefing conducted by a White House staff person, or was it by a Justice Department person? MS. MYERS: He's briefed regularly by a White House staff on a number of issues. Again, I'm not going to get into exactly who briefs him on what subjects. Q Another subject? Q On another subject. Q Now we're going to do gays in the military. (Laughter.) MS. MYERS: I welcome it. Q How close are you to signing the biodiversity treaty? MS. MYERS: As you know, the President's giving a speech on Earth Day tomorrow. We'll have more to say about it then. Q Any details on where or when that speech is yet? MS. MYERS: It's at 11:30 a.m. and I don't know where yet. Q Dee Dee, is this a major policy address? How would you characterize the speech tomorrow? MS. MYERS: I would characterize it as a Earth Day speech. I wouldn't look for any major departures from his past positions on these things. But, again, I don't want to get too much into what he's going to talk about tomorrow. Q On or off campus? Q Is this at a location outside the White House? MS. MYERS: It will be somewhere in Washington. We don't know exactly where yet. Q Dee Dee, what foreign leaders has the President talked to since Friday on the situation in Bosnia? MS. MYERS: Only Prime Minister Major. And again, he'll try to reach President Mitterrand again this morning. Q David Owen said yesterday and Joe Biden said today -- both of them agree that the peace process is not going to work, that the Serbs are not going to sign on. Does the administration still believe that it can work and that they will sign on? MS. MYERS: Obviously, the ultimate goal is some sort of peaceful resolution to the conflict in Bosnia. As you know, the administration is considering a wide variety of options at this point. The situation there in and around Srebrenica and the rest of Eastern Bosnia is quite serious. And the President will meet with his Bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on this. Q Is that a question they're going to try to be deciding whether or not the peace plan remains viable? MS. MYERS: Again, they'll be reviewing a number of options, including the peace plan. Q Does the group that he's meeting with today include Reg Bartholomew? MS. MYERS: I don't believe he's here. But it will be among the usual -- Secretary Christopher, Secretary Aspin, General Powell. Q Dee Dee, do you have anything on the apparent encounter by U.S. F-15s over Bosnia today -- some aircraft violating the no-fly zone? MS. MYERS: No, I don't. I'll get back to you on that. Q Will the President be meeting with every one of the leaders coming to town for the Holocaust Museum? MS. MYERS: He will. He'll be meeting, as you know, with Vaclav Havel today and with Lech Walesa tomorrow, and then with the rest of the group tomorrow afternoon. Q As a group, or one by one? MS. MYERS: I believe it's as a group. Now, Havel and Walesa asked for meetings early and these have been on the agenda for quite some time. But he will meet with all of the foreign heads of state that are here. Q Dee Dee, has the President decided whether he supports the gay and lesbian civil rights act? And has anything been worked out for him to address the march on Sunday? MS. MYERS: I think he'll probably have a letter or some kind of a statement to the march. We haven't worked out the exact details of that. Q Not a live phone hook-up? MS. MYERS: Probably not, given the logistics of getting to Boston. The speech, as you know, is at 4:00 p.m. The answer to the other part of your question is, no, he hasn't taken a position on it. Q You said that speech in Boston was at 4:00 p.m.? MS. MYERS: I believe so, yes. Q Do you know what it's on? MS. MYERS: We'll still working out -- Q General Vessey's coming back tonight from Vietnam. When will he be meeting with the President? MS. MYERS: No specific meeting is scheduled. We'll talk to him at some point and see. We look forward to his report, but exactly how he'll make that report is unclear. Q So he's not going to come immediately to the White House? MS. MYERS: No. Q The AIDS czar -- how close are you? MS. MYERS: Still working on it. Q Drug czar? Q Do you expect it before the march? MS. MYERS: I don't have a time line on it. Q Did the President ask Senator Mitchell to try the Lloyd Cutler ploy to break the filibuster? MS. MYERS: I don't believe so. Q Why not? MS. MYERS: He's just not going to. Q Are Senate Democrats here at this hour? MS. MYERS: No, that's tomorrow -- tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. Q Update on the stimulus, possible scaling down -- MS. MYERS: As you know, the Senate will vote on amendments today. We'll continue to talk. The President is committed to some kind of a jobs package; we'd like to see it passed. And we'll continue in conversations throughout the day and see where we end up. Q When this briefing is over can you give us word through the speaker or whatever whether the President's talked to Janet Reno? MS. MYERS: We'll be happy to. Q It's become a pressing question for the last several hours. MS. MYERS: No, just this minute that I've been here, and I haven't had a chance to follow up on it, Helen. Q Does he have an opinion on Hatfield? MS. MYERS: I mean, obviously, he prefers -- he offered a compromise package of $12.2 billion. He believes that that's the best alternative, believes that he's obviously willing to take a second look at the package. And I think the Senate will vote on that today, and we're hopeful that the President's bill, which will be the Mitchell amendment, will be the one that will be approved. Q Dee Dee, is there any White House official that will be at the march on Sunday? MS. MYERS: Somebody will be there representing the President. I don't know who yet. Q Well, has it been decided how he's going to address? Is it going to be a videotape or a phone call? MS. MYERS: I think it will probably be a letter, but there hasn't been a final decision on that yet. Q The official will read the letter, is that what it sounds like? MS. MYERS: Correct. Q Lloyd Bentsen came in here this morning. Do you know what was that about? Was that about this Waco thing? MS. MYERS: No, actually it wasn't. It may have come up, but it was about economic issues. Q On health care -- is the 17th of May still the target? MS. MYERS: That's still the target. Q And there's talk about a Joint Session of Congress speech at the end of May -- MS. MYERS: We haven't resolved exactly how the President will present the health care plan to the people. I wouldn't rule that out as an option, but no decisions have been made. END10:08 A.M. EDT	2

Our doctors' monopoly is exactly the same as in the U.S., if not more powerful now that they can dictate insurance payment rates, but I don't know an answer to this one.

Well, what American private insurance plans cover travel expenses??? Since our public insurance plans are publicly accountable, one can raise a stink in the media to try and extort benefits beyond which one is entitled (hey, not Alberta's fault that he lives there) ...

It's worth thinking about. It's regular practice in a hospital to figure out who needs to get at what facilities. Don't Americans have to arrange in advance for operations too? I think that there are two standards being applied here, and that Canada can't give Beverly Hills-style treatment to everybody. It's not a big brother list ... it's more like calling around town for a table for dinner ... >Yeah, but private nonprofit foundations have to make money somehow, >especially in the hospital business. Yes, and the Tories in Ottawa are trying to make them do that rather than hope for a bigger grant from the feds and their province the next time around. Whether it's using mop a couple of weeks longer or even selling services to Americans (remember, our system is cash based and since our health care infrastructure is overbuilt except in specialties that require larger populations to generate business, why not? The alternative is closing unused wards ... business.). >whether Canadians would be thrilled at the prospect of their own >health services catering toward Americans, who would be willing >to pay more than they do, is another issue entirely), it must be >noted that they said they were doing it partly because their grants >from the province were getting smaller If those grants are so >insubstantial, why the need to attract foreigners to make up the >difference? You answered the question yourself ... "private nonprofit foundations have to make money somehow", and I think that it's about time that they acted like the private hospitals that they are. Personally, I'm fed up with Canadian socialists trying to tell everyone that their health care is free when we are actually buying insurance (that's one at you, Bob Rae!!). >>The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total >>outlay, and are compiled use the same methods by the OECD that yield >>the 13-14% figure for the U.S. > >But don't the US figures include dentistry and optometry where the >Canadian one (until recently, anyway) didn't? Since we have always been evaluated in an OECD style, I don't see how ... remember, OECD counts both private and public funds, and in Canada like France and Germany, 30% of health care spending is private funds (i.e., not the basic health insurance money). >>>So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse. >> >>How?

Yes, the infrastructure will be there. >But will everybody be able to continue using it at the same rate. Minor copayments can flush out abusers. Remember that our "system" is only an insurance policy. But our costs aren't rising fast enough to ensure adequate copayments/deductibles ... last year, Quebec's user-fee proposal came out with the number of "$5" as the necessary hike that could be done through a copayment rather than give the QMA a raise. And it's not contract time yet, as far as I can tell from UPI Clarinet ... Even the new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly "libertarian" faction, holds our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these). But no mention of copayments anywhere to be seen ... but cutting public spending all over the place, and bringing back the death penalty, with little haste if elected. >I know that, for Pete's sake, I live right on the border. I know the >Canadian system isn't socialized medicine (unlike Britain's NHS). Sorry! (-; It's just that I even run into people from Buffalo and from Michigan who don't know ... >The point is, that means that if the money runs low in the plan, >you're out of luck unless you can afford it yourself. Yeah, but there'd be a lot of lead-time and a health-care crisis that would preclude it. If provincial governments (as bad as some of them are; heck, we have the NDP cleaning up a spending mess made by the Conservatives in Saskatchewan - embarassing!) can be so irresponsible, there is still reallocation --- health insurance is so important that it's about the only thing that can inspire open rebellion and violent insurrection outside of the hockey rink. Right now, attempts to get the system and its users to learn good habits are being treated like cod-liver oil ... >>>Would the private insurers take up the slack? They'd be under no >>>obligation to. Of course, they could eventually make money again, >>>but if what you say is true, they'd be loathe to do so (and out of >>>practice in handling such basic services, too). >> >>Some of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries of >>American companies, and their parents provide full insurance down >>here.

Most Americans are fearful of a single-tier system ... (-; Seriously, there are few areas that have sufficient population for a two/more-tiered system like what the French have ... a health policy prof, D.G. Shea, has cited studies in the NEJM that indicate having a population of 500,000 is necessary for adequate competition ... and in Canada, there are only four cities west of the Great Lakes with that population or larger. Anyways, the numbers show that costs have held steadier than those in the U.S. and barring any future Chernobyl-like crisis, sudden transients in spending are unlikely. In fact, the health allocation is one of the most well-behaved sectors of spending up north so any talk of bankruptcy is talk-radio fodder far away from the border. >If the provinces hit fiscal rough spots and have to cut back, the >things private insurers have to offer will seem less and less like >luxuries and the gap will be more and more noticeable. This won't be overnight, and something like this would force Canada to have a system more like the French one ... but that's not a bad thing, and the change will be minimal (i.e., add copayments and frustrate the socialists chanting "Hey, it's *free*!"). gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.

I believe that this is not contradictory on the basis that the quality of media reporting varies greatly based on the subject at hand. The media has proven itself very accurate is the areas of presenting raw, undisputed data.

The American media has failed us in its analysis of complex events, however. I'm sure that we can come up with many news stories that have left us angry because so many facts have been ommitted.

The story that you bring to light was regarding the new sex survey. While I'm sure that due to lazyness some of the data was ommitted from the article, I would venture to guess that the data that was presented did not deviate from the survey. I do, however, think that it would be folly to have blind faith in a single newswriter's analysis of this data. In this particular case, there was little analysis, and the reader was left to draw his/her own convictions. Many netters, Mr. Cramer included, often forget that the American media are merely a number of businesses, who's purpose in life is to make money for their owners and stockholders.

The survey presented, according to Mr. Cramer, a value called the median- which one used this makes us believe that 1/2 of the males had 7.3 plus sex partners and 1/2 of the males had 7.3 or less sex partners. Homosexuals are purported to make up only 1%. In this case, the majority of people with 7.3 plus sex partners are heterosexual. It is my feeling that median was not the intended word usage. But if it is then we have little evidence to support Mr. Cramer claims about gay promiscuity > hetero promiscuity. > >Many netters, Mr. Cramer included, often forget that the >American media are merely a number of businesses, who's >purpose in life is to make money for their owners and >stockholders.

The News Media is a business and as such becomes skewed because of where its loyalties lie. There is an old statement by a man ( and I cannot remember him or his statment exactly) but it warns against the merger of business and news reporting, because of the obvious consequences.

Many more have inadequate coverage, meaning that they could be bankrupted by a major illness.(23) In fact, one health care expert says that because only 1 percent of the population has private longterm-care insurance, "virtually any American could be impoverished by a prolonged disabling illness."(24) Additionally, as many as 40 percent of those eligible for some forms of public aid do not receive it. These gaps in health care result directly from the fact that the United States is the only major industrialized nation (other than South Africa) without a national health insurance plan providing universal coverage while controlling costs. ****************************************************************** From: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - _We're Number One, Where America Stands -- and Falls -- in the New World Order_ by Andrew L Shapiro.

The idea of a minimum wage is considered a good one. And in these times of economic difficulty, the Washington legislature is propossing to raise the State MinWage from $4.25 (the federal level) to $4.90 (fifteen cents over Oregon's). It would seem to me that this increase does not keep pace with inflation, that the minimum wage should be to $6.08 by my figures, so it is proposed that we raise the minimum wage to $6.50 per hour by 1 July and then give a 10% cost of living increase every 4 July. and anyone who doesn't like it is obviously a country club republican getting rich off the exploitation of poor people. chus pyotr -- pyotr@halcyon.com Sometimes Pyotr Filipivich, sometimes Owl.

Typical response: lack of logic. Define 'deviant': someone who deviates from the normal. Ok, so far. Define 'normal': erm, umm. If you define yourself as normal then it is for you to prove that you are (within limits, which then brings in the question, what are the limits? For you we may have to broaden them to other's intolerance ;-) ) 'normal'. Difficult to prove. From what you have posted it must follow that `normal` to you means someone without compassion and a sense of justice. But it does look as if you went to the Clayton school of logic, doesn't it? |> |> > how disparaging you are towards political minorities, |> |> Sexual deviants do not comprise a "political minorit[y]". Again an astounding lack of logic! Wow! You must define what you say such that everyone agrees. Here you have used the phrase "sexual deviant". How in the hell do you define that? As someone who does something sexually that _you_ don't? By this definition you most probably mean the majority of the planet. How do you know that your next door neighbour doesn't like custard to be spread over his genetalia then have it licked off by his wife? Is this sexual deviancy? How do we know that you don't like something sexually which others may find repulsive? Is having sex doggy fashion a sexual deviancy? Please be more specific, and where you do, back up your claims. Or I may have to go to hospital due to laughing too much at yours and Clayton's postings. Secondly, if we assume for the moment that the phrase 'sexual deviant' means such people as homosexuals, bisexuals &c. (basically everyone you don't like), I think that your phrase "do not comprise a `political minorit[y]`" (why the brackets?) is a non-sequiteur. Gay groups exist which lobby their governments. That is a fact. Prove it false. Hence they are a politial group. You state that they are not a political minority. Are they therefore a political majority? I think you boobed really big on this one.

Many of the women I know would do almost anything rather than be known as a slag, slut or whore. With men however there is *status* attached to being able to fuck constantly. And with gay men, where both partners can prove status through their constant verility then you are going to get a situation where there is a lot of sex.

Sorry, but this is a red herring. Are you contending that the "mountain of forms" are processed by Blue Cross? Having had Blue Cross insurance both as a government employee and as an employee of a private corporation, I saw no difference between the two sets of forms. Moreover, the administrative costs associated with Medicare/Medicaid, the two primary forms of "government" insurance are considerably lower than the average for private insurance companies. (5% versus 14%-16%). If you have any evidence that Blue Cross bears a heavier burden in insuring government employees than private employees, post it. Otherwise, try to stick to factual assertions. > >> And as the original post implied, it is private insurers in the US >> whose administrative costs are significantly higher than the administrative >> costs of tax-supported health care systems in Canada and elsewhere. > > Only those that remain paper-bound and refuse to standardize. Well now, that's an interesting defense of the "free enterprise" system. Are you contending that it is government intervention that prevents private insurance companies from "standardizing?" In fact, it is true that some of the red-tape burden stems from the lack of standardization among the 1500 or so private insurers in the US, but it's a little difficult to understand how this is anything other than "free enterprise" at work. By the way, Barron's, the bible of Wall Street, this week admitted that administrative costs were significantly lower in Canada because "....a single-payer system is always cheaper...".

Anybody got 'em??? I thought the Motor Voter bill passed. In any case, my experiance with Tennessee's voter registration system (which you can register with by mail, by the way) is that nobody who is interested in voting is being denied access to registration. All it requires is just the tiniest bit of interest on the registrant's part and thinking about the election once in the eleven months prior to it. (Once you register it's good unless you miss for years worth of elections of move.) It's easy to register now. I simply don't see the value in going out and trying to get people registered who don't have enough gumption to even write and have the proper forms sent to them.

Do it in private, and it won't be a problem. But the reason that the homosexual activists are so hot on antidiscrimination laws is that they want: 1. To be able to wear that lovely chiffon evening gown to work, and not have people get disgusted; 2. To be able to wear their NAMBLA T-shirt and not worry about getting fired; 3. To be able to have access to young boys, so that they start making the next generation of homosexuals.

Let's try that again: Why was the BATF concerned about surprise when they intended to serve the warrant by knocking on the door?

Right? James Madison, Federalist Paper 41: "It has been urged and echoed, that the power ``to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States,'' amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common defense or general welfare... "No stronger proof could be given of the distress under which these writers labor for objections, than their stooping to such a misconstruction. Had no other enumeration or definition of the powers of the Congress been found in the Constitution, than the general expressions just cited, the authors of the objection might have had some color for it; ... But what color can the objection have, when a specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms immediately follows, and is not even separated by a longer pause than a semicolon? ... Nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars. -- cdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com --If you believe that I speak for my company, OR cdt@vos.stratus.com write today for my special Investors' Packet...	2

NOT an accurate analogy. David Koresh did not take a bunch of hostages and then call the BATF with a ransom note. You make it sound as if the BATF showed up to save those children in the first place. I have some interesting news for youBATF has absolutely NO jurisdiction in child abuse cases. It seems to me that the BATF showed up, took the Davidians hostage. Then the FBI showed up, negotiated to have a few of the hostages released, but were unable to keep the BATF from killing the rest of the poor people trapped inside the compound.

Today's paper quotes the medical examiner as saying that there is no evidence of gunshot wounds in any of the recovered bodies. At the beginning of this siege, it was reported that while Koresh had a class III (machine gun) license, today's paper quotes the government as saying, no, they didn't have a license. Today's paper reports that a number of the bodies were found with shoulder weapons next to them, as if they had been using them while dying -- which doesn't sound like the sort of action I would expect from a suicide. Our government lies, as it tries to cover over its incompetence and negligence. Why should I believe the FBI's claims about anything else, when we can see that they are LYING?

There is a vast difference >between Equal Justice under the Law and Egalitarianism. What I meant, if it was not clear, was the intersection set of liberal and libertarian philosophies of "natural rights" and how the government (and Constitutional interpretation in particular) fits into that philosophy. This philosophy engages in the very serious practical error of endowing the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court with an almost totalitarian authority, completely outside of the consent or consensus of The People. This is why Supreme Court nominations are such amazing political fist-fights these days, because He who Controls the Court Rules the Country. The people on the Court may well be trying to do the best job they can, but they are at best a benevolent oligarch, even if you approve of every Supreme Court decision ever. Eventually, an oligarch will arise that will decimate that which you hold dear. Try Supreme Court cases by Jury, and the problem would be mitigated a great deal. Those who would create broad, non-enumerated government powers at any level (as in European Parlamentary Democracies and the current de-facto standard in the U.S.) have essentially engaged in the same fundamental mistake, except that it is some different body that has the totalitarian, virtually unchecked (except by plurality election, death, or retirement), government power. > And *why* should your community be allowed to stop my activities >when I'm not picking your pocket or defrauding you? Just because >you don't like it? Because you find it morally repugnant? This is like asking why the wind blows, unless you can prove that the fact of your engaging in certain activities has absolutely no effect whatsoever on any other human being who has not consented to your engagement in those activities. Very few human activities indeed fit into this category. Even for those few that do, who would you empower to make the judgement of what is and is not a fully autonomous activity? Who defines "picking my pocket" and "defrauding"? Are economic assets a person's only assets, or are peace of mind, stability, confidence in a child's emotional environment, security, and many other things not also a part of a person's assets? What gives you the right to create a moral environment that a parent strongly objects to? What gives you the right to create an environment of social unrest and instability? If you say that what you do does not have those effects, by what authority do you say that? Who is empowered to make these value judgements? >How >would *you* feel if I got a gang together and found xtianity >(or insert your favorite cause here) morally repugnant and >passed laws to outlaw its free exercise?

If it did not, and you could muster enough local support to pass an amendment to the local Constitution (by, say, a 3/4 majority) empowering the local government to do so, then I would have to vote with my feet and move to a neighborhood more friendly to my own system of values.

The debate is not whether you or a >communitity would or would not vote away my rights; it is >the propriety of whether that should even be an *option*. When you define "rights" very broadly, there is no practical choice about whether people will or will not infringe upon your rights since these "rights" overlap. Even when rights are defined very narrowly, the government has been empowered to prevent others from infringing on your rights. The fundamental question is, by whose authority is that power created. If you support the current situation with a "natural rights" Supreme Court (rather than an "original understanding" Supreme Court or, even better, Supreme Court by Jury), you are consenting to having nine lawyers in Washington, D.C. create those powers out of the air. In my "Fractal Federalism" scenario, it is a broad consensus of The People (i.e. the amendment process) that creates those powers. >> Certainly not the only cause, Mike, but people in a local neighborhood >> should have a voice in what goes on in that neighborhood.

EDT MS. MYERS: At 1:00 p.m., we're having a press conference, Bill, in the East Room. And then Saturday the President will leave here at roughly 8:00 a.m. and fly down to Jamestown. He will spend the day there, overnight at Camp David. On Sunday, it's unclear exactly what time he'll leave Camp David and fly to Boston. He'll leave from Hagerstown. The press plane will leave from Washington. He will meet with some -- Q What kind of a plane is that he's taking? MS. MYERS: That he's taking? He'll probably take a C- 20. Q From Hagerstown? MS. MYERS: From Hagerstown. Air Force One doesn't fly out of Hagerstown, apparently. Q How will the pool travel? MS. MYERS: The pool will have to meet him ahead of time. So I guess the pool will travel with the press plane and wait for him at the airport. There is currently no provision -- and I'll double-check, because there's currently no provision -- I think that's standard operating practice. Q The pool is not going to meet him and watch him get on the plane at Hagerstown? MS. MYERS: I don't believe so. Q What time does he have to be in Boston? MS. MYERS: He's going to meet there with a group of citizens, mostly people who supported us during the campaign, at around 1:30 p.m. We're still working out the final times. Q At the airport? MS. MYERS: No, it will be at the Boston Harbor Hotel. And then he will also meet with some -- a youth group that authored something called Project 21. The speech to the publishers is actually at 3:15 p.m. It will be followed by Q&A. And then after the speech and Q&A, he'll attend a reception with the publishers, and then return to Washington from Boston. And that's it for the weekend. Q Has the President seen the report from -- or the letter, communication from the foreign service officers; also, obviously, the communication from Madeleine Albright? And what is his reaction to their call on him? MS. MYERS: Well, obviously, the letter was written to Secretary Christopher. I believe Secretary Christopher received the letter on Saturday. He reviewed it and met with the authors on Monday to discuss their views. He believes it's an important part of the policy-making process and is taking their views into account as we go forward in the development of the Bosnia policy. Q What is the President's reaction? MS. MYERS: The President hasn't seen the letter. It was something that was directed towards Secretary Christopher. In terms of -- he hasn't seen specifically the letter, but in terms of their concerns generally, what the President has said is that there are a lot of options on the table now, including ones that weren't there before. And I think he's, as is everybody, gravely concerned about the situation in Bosnia. Q Is he influenced by that? I mean, how does he feel about the fact that all of the specialists in that area -- those desk officers -- MS. MYERS: Many of the specialists in that area -- I think that that is clearly part of the process. It's something -- their views will clearly be considered. I think Secretary Christopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views. I think he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that those opinions ought to be considered, particularly from people who work closely on the issues. Q What do you mean, there are options on the table that weren't there before? MS. MYERS: I think the President said last week that there were options, such as lifting the arms embargo to the Bosnian Muslims, that had been previously off the table that are now being considered. Q Dee Dee, in terms of those options, Madeleine Albright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action by the U.S. if the Europeans did not go along. Is that on the table? MS. MYERS: Well, I can't discuss anything that would -- any conversations that would have happened between Ambassador Albright and the President. But I think the President has said he would certainly -- is working with our European allies. He's had a number of conversations with European leaders and is trying to build some consensus there. Q Will he reach a decision -- will he have anything specific to say today? MS. MYERS: No. I mean, in term of there will be no new announcement of policy today. Q Does your statement mean he has ruled out unilateral action? MS. MYERS: He's continuing to consult with our allies at this point. He has said -- I think he's been fairly clear about it, that the he believes that the U.S. needs to act in concert with its allies on this. Q On that point, does he believe that the U.S., though, does have built-in authority from the United Nations already to take unilateral action? MS. MYERS: Well, I think the U.N. Resolution 770 makes it clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian relief effort. I think the broader point is that anything we do, any options that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is consistent with U.N. authority, and if it's not, we'll work with our allies to make sure that we get it. Q Dee Dee, then how does the White House someone as distinguished as Elie Wiesel, who says that not enough is being done to stop the atrocities going on in Bosnia? MS. MYERS: I think that that's why we're considering additional options. I think that Mr. Wiesel's comments yesterday were quite compelling. The situation in Bosnia is tragic. The President is very concerned about it. He has -- I think President Clinton has worked very hard to take further actions to continue to isolate Serbia in the world community. Clearly, we're considering other options because the President is concerned that perhaps it's not enough. Q In terms of what you were just talking about, it sounds like Resolution 770 justifies unilateral action by the U.S. to protect humanitarian -- MS. MYERS: I don't think it -- I wouldn't use the word justify. It permits unilateral action by any country in protecting the delivery of humanitarian relief. But I think that's just an explanation of the resolution. I think any action that we take will be consistent with U.N. resolutions or we'll work with our allies to make sure that it is permissible or we'll get further action. Q The President and other officials have ruled out unilateral U.S. action in Bosnia in the past. You're declining to do that this morning. MS. MYERS: No, I said the President has said repeatedly that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this. Q That doesn't mean that he won't act alone, which has been said before explicitly. MS. MYERS: I don't mean to imply a change in policy. The President has said all along that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this. Q One other little question. Did he know about this letter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers? MS. MYERS: I don't believe so. Secretary Christopher -- they may have had a private conversation about it. The President has not seen it. Q They met on Monday, right? Christopher met -- surely, he must have brought that up -- MS. MYERS: Again, they may have talked privately about it, but -- Q Dee Dee, what you're saying is that the Albright recommendation has been rejected, is that correct? MS. MYERS: No, I didn't say that at all. I said I won't -- I said I wouldn't comment on any conversations or communications. Q She's advocating unilateral action and you're saying, in effect, that we will not take unilateral action. MS. MYERS: I am not confirming anything that Madeleine Albright may or may not have recommended. Q Given the sometimes delicate, complicated and frustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue, does the President find this kind of letter from 12 foreign service officers of the State Department helpful to that process, hurtful to that? MS. MYERS: I think that their views are obviously being considered. The Secretary received that memo on Saturday and two days later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing of their views, of the basis for their views, to discuss in greater detail the options that they had presented in the letter. Q Doesn't it put some kind of pressure on -- additional pressure on him now from within his own administration to act regardless of what the allies may or may not do? MS. MYERS: I think clearly there's a broad policy review underway now. And the President and his advisors are considering a number of options, including some of those outlined in the letter from the folks over at the State Department. Now, no decisions have been made on that yet, but I think that there is a through review underway, and that their opinions are being very seriously considered. Q If I can just follow up, I guess what I'm looking for is what was his reaction to this letter? Did he say, good, this bolsters my position? Or did he say, damn, this is just what I don't need right now? MS. MYERS: I think he said this helps contribute substantively to the debate. It's important that all views be considered and aired thoroughly, that before he makes a decision he wants to have the best possible advice and information possible, and this, I think in many ways, furthers that goal. Q So internal advice to a Cabinet official or the President -- it's all open now, and you wouldn't take any umbrage or say that they were out of line? MS. MYERS: I think that the fact that Secretary Christopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they had an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is conclusive evidence that their views are welcome. Q Does the policy review include what Madeleine Albright has suggested, and what Joe Biden and others have suggested, which is that the previous U.N. resolutions authorize unilateral action -- military action -- for the delivery of humanitarian -- MS. MYERS: I think all options are on the table. Q The unilateral option is on the table? MS. MYERS: I think all options are on the table. Q We've had two different -- Q Isn't that a change, Dee Dee? Q That would be a change of policy. Q Particularly if it includes ground troops, which has been specifically ruled out. MS. MYERS: I think the President has been -- well, no. I don't -- that is not -- Q Are you talking about all options? MS. MYERS: All options -- I think the President has been fairly clear about that. So let me just review again what he has said. He has said that -- the President has said all options are on the table, with the exception of the introduction of ground troops, which he has never suggested. He has ruled that out from the beginning. Q Hasn't he ruled out unilateral action of any sort? MS. MYERS: He has said that he doesn't believe the U.S. can solve the problems in the former Yugoslavia by itself. I think that there are a number of very complicated options on the table right now. I don't think that -- again, I don't want to comment on specific options that are being considered other than in the broad categories that we've already said -- things like lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims, things that I think we've talked about in broad terms. This is a very complicated situation. The options being presented and considered are very complicated. Q Air strikes on the table? MS. MYERS: Again, I think that's been fairly clearly pointed out that that's something that's being discussed. Q Dee Dee, are ground troops on the -- MS. MYERS: No, ground troops are not being considered. Q You said there was not going to be -- you said you were not announcing a change of policy. Then you said everything is on the table. We're confused. Are unilateral actions on the table? MS. MYERS: All I can tell you is what the President has said -- that he doesn't believe -- that he wants to act in concert with the allies on this. Q Wants to, but he's willing to -- I mean, if they don't go along -- MS. MYERS: He's continuing to consult with our allies on this. He's continuing to have discussions. He's continuing to press them for further action. And I think that's clear. The conversation is ongoing. We're going to continue to work with them to find the best possible solution and next step on this. Q Dee Dee, the allies have taken the position that to conduct any kind of air strikes in Bosnia would have the opposite effect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid; that they feel that their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid would become vulnerable and the Bosnians -- MS. MYERS: I'm not sure that's the consistent -- I mean, I'm not sure who you're referring to. Q The British and the French. Q Yes, the British and French. They've taken the position that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized by any kind of air strikes against the Bosnian military. Does the U.S. believe differently from that? MS. MYERS: The President has had conversations with both Mitterrand and Major, as you know. I think that there is a thorough review of policy going on in those countries as well. And I don't want to comment on the nature of the President's discussions other than to say that he's continuing to consult with our allies as we move forward and he's continuing to press them for further action. And I think that process is ongoing. Q the other day voted against any military intervention yesterday. Does the President regard that as the end of the line or does he does still hold out some possibility of unilateral action? The allies have been very, very plain that they do not want to do anything. MS. MYERS: The consultations are ongoing. That's all I can tell you at this point. Q Are you saying that there won't be any announcement on Bosnia today in the press conference? MS. MYERS: No, that is not the intention of the press conference. Q What is the intention? MS. MYERS: It's an opportunity to take questions. He may have a brief -- I'm sure he'll have a brief opening statement, but it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on Bosnia. That will not happen. Q Can you tell us what the subject of the opening statement is? MS. MYERS: It's sort of a general statement of where we are. Q After the first hundred days, you mean? MS. MYERS: It's not a long statement. I mean, this is just generally. Don't look for any major policy pronouncements. Q Do you know what the opening statement is? MS. MYERS: But it's -- perhaps later today I'll be able to tell you with more certainty -- I think that's still under review. But the overriding purpose of this -- it's not a mystery; it's not meant to be. It's just to take questions. Q It would be helpful to know whether -- what the opening statement is on. MS. MYERS: Since the major purpose here is just to take questions, it's not completely resolved yet. Q Dee Dee, one policy that was expected last week and that the White House, you and George seemed to indicate we might get, would be an AIDS czar. Will he announce that today? And what's the delay on that? MS. MYERS: I don't think we meant to imply -- I think we said it would happen soon. I don't think we meant to imply with any certainty that it would be this week. It is coming soon. I don't anticipate that happening today. Q What's the delay? Isn't this the perfect time to announce an AIDS czar? MS. MYERS: I don't know that it's a delay. I think the process is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through the necessary background checks, and to make sure that we've crossed the t's and dotted the i's before we make an announcement. Q Dee Dee, what are Zoe Baird's qualifications for the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board? And why wasn't her appointment announced here? MS. MYERS: The qualifications -- I don't know if there's a specific list; I'll have to check and see. I think there are a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds. Many of them have long histories in intelligence or other government service. I think there's a broad variety of views across political spectrum and across backgrounds that are represented there. We never made a formal announcement other than the Chairman of the Board, which is Admiral William Crowe. Q Why would he appoint her, though, if the American people and many in the Senate rejected her for another government job? MS. MYERS: I don't believe that the American people ever had -- voted on her. And I certainly -- she was never rejected in the Senate. She never went up there for a hearing. But the President believes she's a very competent person. He's said that -- Zoe Baird -- do you understand what the question is? Zoe Baird is on the President's Foreign Intelligence -- Q You said she never went up there for a hearing? Q Her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage over violating federal laws? MS. MYERS: Right, she never -- she was never -- but you said she was rejected by the Senate. I was just simply trying to point out that she was never voted on by the Senate. Q So you don't think that is any problem? MS. MYERS: I don't think there's any problem. Q She has been appointed to this board, is that a fact? MS. MYERS: Yes. Q Does she need confirmation for this? Does she need confirmation to be a member of the -- MS. MYERS: No. It's a presidential appointment. Q Usually, announcements are made here at the White House. Was there a decision not to announce her publicly? MS. MYERS: We didn't make an announcement. People who asked were told who the members of the board were. We didn't make an official announcement. If anybody's interested in that we can certainly put out the list of names. Q I'd like to know. Q Don't such board members -- don't you normally as a matter of -- routinely put out releases on all these boards and presidential appointment regardless of their dimension? MS. MYERS: Not always. But, again, I'm happy to put this out. Q Isn't that the standard practice? Q That was past practice. MS. MYERS: Again, I'm happy to put it out. We'll put out a list of the members of the board today. Q Dee Dee, I don't want to try to fail to let you get out of this swamp but -- (laughter) -- all I really want to know is hasn't it been the practice in this administration for such announcements to be made routinely? MS. MYERS: I think generally but not always. And we're happy to put that out today. Q What is the board, what is her title, what is the size of the board? MS. MYERS: There is roughly a dozen members on the board. It is a civilian board, although their are some, obviously, retired military personnel on the board that provide input into intelligence policy for the President. Again, the chairman of that board is Admiral William Crowe. Q And did he recommend Baird? Q What's the name of the board? MS. MYERS: It's the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, PFIAB. Q What's her qualification -- that she had employed an illegal alien? Is that -- (laughter) -- MS. MYERS: Do you want an answer to the question or you just want to make a joke? Q Let me phrase it another way. Why shouldn't this appointment be viewed as a pay-back for the difficulty she had a couple of months ago? MS. MYERS: Because it's not. Q What's her experience in foreign intelligence? MS. MYERS: She's an experienced attorney, someone who the President believes is very competent and qualified. And I think part of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input. Not everybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert; that is not the board's mission. It is to provide civilian input for the President as he makes decisions regarding intelligence matters. He believes she's very qualified, very competent person, enormously talented and has said that throughout. Q Is this just a figment of my overactive imagination, or was there discussion early on about abolishing the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board? MS. MYERS: I don't think so. On December 24th, when he announced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he would -- had appointed Admiral Crowe as the head of the board. So I don't believe there's ever been any -- Q Earlier than that, during the transition. MS. MYERS: No, I don't believe so. It was announced, again, on December 24th. Admiral Crowe couldn't be there, but it was announced. Q Are members paid? MS. MYERS: I don't believe so, but I'll double-check. Q On another subject, on Waco, how do you explain the discrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the bodies that are coming out of Waco and the state? I guess it's the Texas Ranger reports. MS. MYERS: Most of the information is coming -- the federal information is coming from the site. Clearly, there's been some discrepancies and the Justice Department is looking into it. Officials in the Justice Department were told, I believe the day before yesterday, that there were several bodies found with bullet holes. I think there's some discrepancy about that, and the Justice Department is looking into it. Q Is the President going to get involved in trying to sort out what seems to be becoming a jurisdictional morass down there, with some people withdrawing, others saying they're in charge, but others -- Justice, FBI, Texas Rangers -- all grabbing a piece of this? MS. MYERS: I don't know that he's going to try to mediate the dispute. I mean, I'll let you know if there's anything he intends to do about it. But as you know, there are several levels of investigation ongoing, and we're hopeful that they can work together. Q Is there any one agency or official down there in charge of everything? MS. MYERS: I don't know. I'll have to get back to you on that. Q What is the subject matter of Sunday's speech? MS. MYERS: It's going to be fairly general. I don't think it's going to be any specific announcements. I think it's going to be sort of a -- Q Does he have a topic that he's going to talk about? MS. MYERS: We're still working on it. But I wouldn't look for any announcements of, like, the drug czar or something like that. Q Is it sort of a 100 days speech, sort of "my excellent adventure for 100 days"? (Laughter.) MS. MYERS: Not exactly, but I think he'll take a little bit broader look about what's happened in the last -- Q Foreign, domestic? MS. MYERS: A little bit of both, but I think a lot of domestic. Q And overview. MS. MYERS: Yes, more of an overview than a specific policy announcement. Q Has there been an agreement yet on a forum by which the President will address the gay rights march on Sunday? MS. MYERS: It will be a letter read to the crowd by Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi. Q Is that available? MS. MYERS: Not yet, but it will be. Sure. Q Are you going to put it out here or -- MS. MYERS: We'll probably put it out here on Sunday. Q Travel next week? MS. MYERS: Unclear. Q What was the question? Q Likely? MS. MYERS: I don't -- Q Likely? Possible? MS. MYERS: Possible. Q What's possible? MS. MYERS: Travel. Q George mentioned yesterday campaign finance reform and national service legislative proposals next week. Do you have days yet for them? MS. MYERS: Not yet. Q Can you tell us which order? MS. MYERS: Campaign finance reform first; national service later in the week. Q Is there any coverage tomorrow in Williamsburg? MS. MYERS: No. Q And any report in the aftermath of the day? MS. MYERS: Any readout from the day? Q Readout. MS. MYERS: It's possible. Jeff Eller will be down there. I think he can go through what the President did during the day. We don't expect any photo op or anything, other than departure here in the morning. Q Dee Dee, the President has not made a regular practice, as some of his predecessors have, of going to Camp David. In fact, he's been there -- what -- once or twice? MS. MYERS: Twice. Q Why this weekend? MS. MYERS: He went two weekends ago, as you know, on the way home from his father-in-law's funeral. I think that they found it to be a good experience and a nice way for them to spend some time together as a family. And this is just an opportunity to do the same. Q There's no march there. Q It has nothing to do with the march here? MS. MYERS: No. Q Since he's going to be in town Sunday morning now instead of in Jamestown, have you thought about him making a quick pass-by, fly-over -- (laughter) -- MS. MYERS: He'll fly straight to Boston. Q Flying straight did you say? (Laughter.) Q George took a question yesterday on Waco. The President had said on Tuesday in the Rose Garden that there was a minor disagreement on tactics between the military advisors and the FBI. And the question was whether you knew exactly what that was and whether it related to the use of the particular kind of tear gas. Do you have an answer on that? MS. MYERS: I don't. I'll check. THE PRESS: Thank you. END10:59 A.M. EDT	2

McManus, National President of the John Birch Society > When McManus says, "We have the world's best medical care," I can hardly believe he's referring to a system: 1. That costs us 14 percent of our GDP, while there isn't a single other country in the industrialized world that spends more than 10 percent. 2. That leaves 37 million of us with no coverage, even though all the other systems in the industrialized world cover virtually everyone. 3. Yet, Americans rank near the bottom of the list in terms of life expectancy, childhood immunization rate, infant mortality, and many preventable diseases. 4. We pay, on average, about $1000 each for MRIs. (To put that in perspective, they cost $177 in Japan.) 5. The average US company spends over 2500 dollars a year per employee on health benefits. Seven hundred to 1500 is the range just about everywhere else. How can anyone say that such a system is the best in the world? The only thing the USA health care system is good at is showering well-insured patients with a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharging for it. And the "private" system of insurers and paperwork is so bloated and inefficient that it itself sucks up over 100 billion dollars a year in money from every other sector of society - individuals, government, and industry. Of the < 800 billion dollars Americans threw into the bottomless pit of health care costs last year, the Consumer's Union estimated that at least 200 billion was thrown away on overpriced, useless, and even downright harmful tests and procedures, and the most bureaucratic, regulated insurance system in the world. There are more than 1200 different private insurers in the USA. But did the "private competition" stimulate more efficient paperwork? Ask any doctor who's had to hire a full-time clerk to deal with it all! The competition among hospitals is driving costs UP, not down. The competition among hospitals for both doctors and patients has encouraged the hospitals to traffic in expensive superfluous equipment. Spending millions on expensive machines of dubious value that spend 80 percent of the day idle isn't my idea of the world's best health care system. Competition among specialists is driving them to perform dangerous and expensive procedures where they are very marginally helpful. I'm especially thinking of heart surgery and some women's surgeries like hysterectomy and Cesarean section. Sound like the world's best health care system? Ever notice how, every time someone tries to bring about some real change in health care, the Libbies start bashing Canada's system? First of all, Hillary Clinton is not advocating another Canadian system. I think that's been made abundantly clear in the news for the last couple of months. Where did John F. McManus get that idea, anyway? Let's say you're a Canadian living in a small town near the USA border. Your child needs a complicated procedure only available in city hospitals. The nearest Canadian cities are 6 hours west and 20 hours east, and there's an American city one hour south. Which way are you going to go? Is it because the American system is the "best" in the world, or just for convenience? It still amazes me that people can't seem to see more than just black and white on health care reform. There are a million different ways we ould restructure the system. It's not just a choice between total government control and total private control. I wish the people screaming "socialized medicine" every time soemone wants to change the current syste would INFORM THEMSELVES on health care issues. The current system sucks. I want to keep providers private but that doesn't change the fact that we will never be able to deal with the deficit if we don't REFORM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. Purely private health care without any government intervention doesn't work. Hillary Clinton is not thinking of nationalizing providers or evern insurers. How can you scream "socialized medicine" at her programs? Don't you even know what you're talking about? Ever see Clinton's graphs of projected deficit versus year for the rest of the decade? Notice how the line falls, then starts increasing? Why? I'll give you one wild guess as to which component of spending will overwhelm us if we don't do something about it. PEOPE JUST DOESN'T GET IT. The current health care system is a cancer which is killing our economic well-being. Costs are still rising 10 percent a year even as Americans by the tens of millions go without, or are forced into managed-care programs, which are certainly pretty socialized already if you ask me. A couple of months ago I posted a message asking any Hillary-bashers to please come forward and present (no gimmicks, straight talk) just how THEY would set about keeping costs down. I didn't get a single answer. The only thing I keep hearing from Libbie organizations are press releases filled with evasive platitudes like "give health care back to the people." Just do you expect to do that without serious reforms? What is it about the current system that you would change and how would that help? How can anyone read the news, live under our system, and NOT see these faults? How can we deal with the deficit, our cities, our educational system, our infrastrucure, AIDS, modernizing our industry, etc. if we don't quit throwing away money which could be used to SOLVE those problems? America needs health care reform NOW. Don't just sit there and Hillary-bash, inform yourself! Jim Reynolds -- James P. Reynolds (that's Jim to you and me.) jpr1@lehigh.edu	2

Look at the history of this group. David Koresh has been arrested ?twice? by local police. Both times, he accepted the arrest warrant and went peacefully. So, the feds decide to arrest him. How do they choose to arrest a person with a record of peaceful obedience under arrest? They throw a concussion grenades at his building. In addition, we KNOW that we've been lied to. Initially, we were told that they suspected him of molesting children and having several wives. But these are NOT ATF offenses, were they? So they changed their story, several times. And the original warrant is STILL sealed. And we were told about the rockets and ammunition they had... but did anyone notice any ammo exploding in the fire? They claimed that Koresh hadn't left the compound in months... but people in town report seeing him just a week before the raid. How would I have handled it differently? Well, first, I haven't seen any evidence that the BDs did anything wrong. There's a sealed warrant, and a collection of stories which keep changing about what they did. So I might not have done ANYTHING. OK. Now, supposing that I know what the BDs are being arrested for. Well, they've got a history of accepting arrests... so, I send officers to the door with a warrant. Wearing bulletproof vests. Covered from a distance by sharpshooters. Now, there's no good reason to suspect that these people will do anything, right? Why didn't anyone TRY serving a warrant? OK. Going further. They refuse the warrant. It becomes necessary to raid. You plan a raid. You hear an hour before that there was a leak, and they know your coming. SO what do you do? Well, change your plans, right? Nope... they go ahead with it anyone... including sending in unprotected men to break into the place. It was idiotic. I don't know what I would have ended up doing. But that original raid should NEVER have happened. The shit that came later should NEVER have happened. The full record of the raid should be released to the public to let us know what the hell really happened there.

The alternative to the system is no system at all (patients opted out, doctors opted out, or both).

Yes, but part of the reason is that our most of our markets are too small to sustain many specialists, sometimes not even one, so you pretty well have to be a GP to get paid. And if you do get the training, the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a licence because there is already someone in the business and who cannot fill his/her appointment book.

In that >circumstance, it's hard to blame people for going into specialties. No, I respect people who do specialties (okay, all of my MD friends are (-;) but there's the question of our small market dynamics up north ... if anything, that our private doctors and hospitals sell their services to Americans to generate more business will inflate their effective population served, and thus make some specialties finally viable (i.e., there will be enough customers).

The competition is fake if it exists at all, because they're all interlinked. Look in Der Spiegel or Stern (my girlfriend is in our German department and her uncle is a private practicioner in Saarbrucken) ... no ads for health insurance. While Canada organizes by province, Germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations and regional offices. But remember that we have provinces that have the same population as some major German corporations. Germans have public health insurance, just that it is brokered by smaller entities (actually, brokerage of basic by private firms who'll sell extra insurance to fill out their policies, sort of a voucher system, was one of the first ideas floated in Canada, too). Remember, the Germans don't have HMO's ... a telling sign, 'cos Rochester does and they're also a company town. >But there was a Washington Post article recently about that that said >Canadian doctors often use myelograms instead of MRIs, which require >spinal injections and can cause seizures and headaches.

Good point again. Blue Cross in the U.S. is quite convoluted compared to the Canadian and German insurance funds, which have a minimal organization to coordinate it.

Fante} \endauthor \date {April 20, 1993} \enddate \endtopmatter In a letter to the FBI, David Koresh said: ``Do you want me to pull back the heavens and show you my anger?! ... fear me.'' The 51 day standoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidians ended on April 19 in what appeared to be a mass suicide by fire. Now that the multi-million dollar standoff is over, a few things remain: cleaning up the mess, and assigning blame. \ From the onset of the April 19 tear gas attacks by federal agents, President Clinton already started passing the buck by saying ``Talk to the attorney general or the FBI... I knew it was going to be done, but the decision was {\it entirely theirs}. {\it They} made the tactical decision.'' Enter Attorney General Janet Reno. After most of the Branch Davidians died, Reno said she took ``full responsibility'' for the decision. ``I approved the plan'' she said adding that she ``did not advise him [Clinton] as to the details.'' In fact, she told Clinton that it was ``the best way to go.'' As the fire was roaring through the Branch Davidian's compound Clinton said that he was ``deeply sadened by the loss of life'' and in the same breath that ``the law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended the course of action pursued today.'' Later he went on to say ``I stand by that [Reno's] decision.'' \ How did this all begin? At 0930 on February 28 agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) launched a full-scale, high-profile assault on the Branch Davidian's compound. This raid was much more than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons. The assault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the BATF to show their might and just purpose. \ At the onset of the ``no-knock'' raid, gaggles of heavily armed BATF agents made their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or state that they had a warrant until long after the shooting began. Silently, the agents made their way to the compound's buildings and started their ``search'' by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenades and ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings. \ If unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigues were to attack you, throwing grenades and brandishing firearms, would you not assume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself? The tactics employed by the BATF provoked the battle. \ The initial assualt by the BATF was not successful. Unfortunately, lives were lost on both sides. But, had the assault been a success, the liberal media would have praised the BATF by showing the footage of BATF agents carting away a bunch of gun-wielding religious nuts. Of course, any violation of the cult's rights would have been overlooked and the media would proclaim America's fortune in having super-cop organizations like the BATF that can systematically ``take out'' terroristic groups such as the Branch Davidians. \ As far as I can see, the BATF and the FBI dropped the ball - just like Philadelphia did in the 1985 MOVE crisis which left 11 dead, 250 homeless, and a city block razed. It appears that the BATF has adopted the shoot-first tactic of no-knock raids to execute search warrants. Don't let the BATF convince you that the no-knock raid was justified. No-knock assaults make sense when looking for, say, drugs that can easily be hidden or disposed of in a few seconds. The BATF was looking for illegal weapons, not drugs that could be hidden or flushed down the toilet in a matter of a few seconds. What ever happened to ``This is the police! You are surrounded...''? {\it This policy of no-knock raids, by federal and local agencies, should be restricted}. Further, the use of military firepower against presumed innocent citizens is a very scary idea, and is why the Davidians were justified in using lethal force to ensure that their fourth ammendment rights [``the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures''] are not denied. \ \ \ \noindent Matthew L.

WE'RE blaming the right people. It is you and others that defend ANY of the actions of the BATF, FBI or Justice Department in this matter, that with each word prove again and again the depth of the hypocrisy, the double standard that people like the Clintons would hold certain Americans to. While at the same time allowing others to do as they please with only excuses to offer their victims. It's all to clear these days, from the comments of the "president" and the rationalizations of his supporters in these groups, that in a liberal Democratic vision of America only a certain select few people can expect to have civil rights enforced, and this administration intends to enforce laws, apply the Constitution and obey the laws only when it suits them to do so.

None of your research supports this; no mental health expert has taken this position. This is *your own* opinion which is not backed up by any research or any knowledge.

Oh, you definitely have a choice. You realize, of course, that you are approaching the two-year anniversary of your crusade. How are you planning on celebrating two years of lies? Incidentally, we are still waiting your crusade against African-Americans, women, and other minorities who also want to "impose their morality on others". After all, they also want the government to "tell peaceful people how to live." Therefore, you really "have no choice", but to continue to point out that being a woman or an African-American is not a lifestyle, but a sickness. It's bullshit, Mr. Cramer.

Other than government land, saved for posterity and the eco-system as well as government function, the remaining land is owned by a smaller percentage of the people than ever before. The game of capitalism is almost won. The game has only to be declared over and we will have to take matters into our own hands and redistribute it again fairly, or else be enslaved in return for a place to live. Here in central California, already, fewer than 30% own all the property and 5% of them own 90% of it. That's twice what it was twenty years ago. Rents are so high that you pay 60% of your income for rent. If you just have a McJob, all you can afford is one room, if that. Some 30% of minimum wage workers are homeless. Unless you both have degrees in technical fields and are working in them, (in the midst of 30% unemployment in high tech jobs!), you will never own anything but a used car if you choose to have more than one child!!! And everywhere else you could afford there are no jobs. The only way to get there is to save and not consume any more than you have to, clothing used, food poor. No movies, no entertainment,, ect. for about five to seven years, and then, if you've saved $20,000, if you can get together that much, and that's ignoring your kids and working two jobs, then you can buy a home in Arkansas or Missouri outright and live somewhere where they flood every other year! That's an exaggeration if you pay close attention to the flood lines on other people's houses and find a sturdy hill, then you can buy one up there! Also buy a rowboat. Missouri's not so bad, if you like the sensation of sleeping in a sweatbox in summer and your car freezing solid in winter. They really do put those heaters into the dipstick hole to keep them warm enough to start with ether!:) Shit, kill the rich and redistribute the livable property.

Extra is kept for the future. You get to stay where you are without paying rent. Land that supports others becomes property of the state. Farmers are welcome to plant crops that people need according to demand and ability and soil quality. If you want to grow sourgum because you always did, and you aren't doing a good job, then we let another farmer grow sorghum, and you grow something else. When people die the land they were entitled to use goes into the public holdings. No one can sell land, but they can trade places with anybody. No one can lease land. The government will locally distribute the use of the land not used for residences. Residences that are insufficient to the families living there can be traded to the public for a larger house and yard according to need and availability. The local land council who vow to live on their land till death to avoid profit ties will decide fairness subject to review by the state and federal land councils. It will cost no more than any fucking thing costs now with fucking assed rent going down a deep dark hole to the owners! Anyone can submit a request for a larger house or land to start a business on, depending on a valid business plan and community needs. Heavy equipment is subject to seizure for the public good or as needed. Heavy equipment operators are encouraged to keep and maintain their own machine and to operate it at a reasonable salary in service to the community. Companies who own many machines are to be divided among the appropriate equipment operators and the rest to be let to valid operators on a need basis. Cost of upkeep is charged. A guild of heavy machine operators is recognized for safety and training's sake. Their council is a subcouncil to the community council. Etc. Etc. Etc. It isn't so hard to think of a better system than we have. All you have to do is realize that the system we have now is not sacrosanct, in fact it's a rigged game that steals you blind and is the most unfair any system could be already!!!!!!!! The trick is to realize that the old rich have been making the rules behind your back and that it's time to kick them off the merry-go-round. Tax the rich to death. They are the ones that converted your 60's school lunch program into the joke it is today. They are the ones who always cut education. They are the ones who always raise the rent when you get a raise. They are the ones who should be not just dislodged but killed for their abuse. I have trouble justifying the death penalty for a poor kid who killed and didn't know why not. I have no trouble justifying the death penalty for the rich who steal countless human lives to feed their greed! Have you paid rent most of your life? Then you have been enslaved, percentage wise, most of your life. We used to be serfs. Now we are called renters, and we are still enslaved to somebody who claims to own land they don't use and make us pay them for it when they did nothing to own it. Most rents in California are enough to buy the apartment house, paynthe taxes and the insurance and have a little left over to travel with! I have seen the books! I know what my landlord pays and to whom! I know what I pay her. I am being forced to buy her a building and then I will be let out at the other end with nothing, when I had as much right as her to live on this planet! And her child will have the money to likewise enslave my child. I hope I find out when I am going to die. I can make things just a little happier form me to be able to destroy her life as she destroyed mine. And maybe I can take a few other landlords with me, and their heirs. That would be worth it.

What's despicable is that this sordid incident is being glommed onto by all sorts of people desperately trying to "get a revolution." It makes "ambulance chasing" by lawyers seem like a harmless pastime. For the last few months, benighted souls have been calling C-SPAN on issues as mundane as budget resolutions, saying that "I don't know, I just have the feeling there is going to be a revolution in this country," and so on. Get real! For a real case study in revolution, go to Blockbuster Video and check out "Underground," a film made about the Weather Underground in the 70's. Even with all the strife back then, the "revolution" never did come. And Waco is supposed to be the spark of the end times? In the tape, it is interesting to see the way the Weatherpersons dance around the issue of one of their defining moments, which was when a few of their comrades managed to blow themselves up manufacturing bombs in a Greenwich village townhouse. The problem, one of them said, was that they were so caught up in their armed struggle that they *forgot* about their own personal safety and weren't "careful." But of course that was *society's* fault, a society that didn't instill a sense of worth in the people, so they neglect their own safety.

Wait a second, you're ignoring major facts here. There was NO attempt to simply serve a warrant. The BATF had a no-knock warrant. The initial firefight began when the BATF threw concussion grenades at the building. (BATF admits this!) >If anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing >the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could >hear it. Let's be realistic here, shall we? You're a member of a rather paranoid religious organization. Someone comes to your building, dressed in black suits, carrying firearms. They throw a concussion grenade at the place, and try to break in. What, exactly, are you going to do? I would not allow anyone to enter my home without first identifying themselves. If someone attacks my home by firing weapons or throwing explosive, I think I'd be entirely justified in defending myself. Regardless of what I think of the BDs, and regardless of whether or not they were guilty of firearms violations, this is NOT the way you treat people in a supposedly free society. <MC> -- || Mark Craig Carroll: <MC> ||"We the people are getting tired of your lies || Univ of Delaware, Dept of CIS|| We the people now believe that it's time || Grad Student/Labstaff Hacker || We're demanding our rights to the answers || carroll@udel.edu || We elect a precedent to state of mind"-Fish	2

A search for illegally held weapons (IF there were any, no evidence yet produced to this effect) does not justify firing into a house with women and children, either.

This is true of ANY answer to a call for help from a fire department by ANY citizen. Since fire departments do answer calls that "deprive resources that might be needed elsewhere" it is not a valid reason for not calling them. Further, since the Davidians had not been found guilty of any crime in a court of law, they are subject to the same protection as any other citizen.

You know, you have a point here, but don't stop with African Americans... When I was in high school in the early 1980s, on various occasions I had knives pulled on me, had friends who were stabbed, and I was beaten up repeatedly by those that couldn't accept me as different. And don't let the teachers off the hook either. On many many occasions, there were teachers that either resented me or were too scared out of their wits by the bullies to even stop the people who attacked me and they would just watch quietly... All of this was in a nice white middle class high school. In fact, we were so nice and white that we made sure that the one black kid in my class was unable to go to the prom with his white girlfriend...

Because the Gun loonies were firing on vehicles with 50mm amunition that has a range of 3000 meters. Next question. The problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place. The sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention. If the FBI had had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults. It really was a no win situation. Koresh had plenty of opportunity to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 ATF officers. Instead he ordered the murder of the children. In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the suicide/murder of his other 80 followers. According to the account given the BATF attempted to serve a warrant upon Koresh at the ranch and were met by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them. The Koresh/gun supporter claim that the BATF started shooting simply does not stand up. If the AFT had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue handguns. For all practical purposes they were unarmed, the B-D followers had automatic weapons. The B-D seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely. The B-D were quite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any time. A commando assault was the only other likely action that could have achieved that objective, that would have been very risky, orders of magintude harder than Antebbe or the Iranian Embassy Seige. Airplanes and Embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch apocalypse was. 6 terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties than 80. Allowing the siege to go on was not an option either, besides the serious risk that Koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the question of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over a prolonged period. The longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared Koresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege. Rather than go in prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon. Can you think of a better way of getting the children out? A 100% certain way? The people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story. This is simply rationalisation. It is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent. That would require them to come up with a solution themselves. Instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through. This conspiracy theory assumes that the BATF deliberately got 4 of its agents killed and that the FBI etc actually enjoy sitting out in the middle of Texas being shot at by religious nutters. Still the conspiracy theory is comforting, it allows them to pretend that WACO proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in resolving a hostage crisis. No govt in the world has ever faced a comparable situation, quite probably there was no manner in which it could be peacefully resolved. The blame does not rest on the FBI, it rests on the fact that Koresh was allowed to get so far, in particular the person who tipped the B-D off in advance has the murder of 4 ATF agents and 17 children on his or her conscience. There are a large number of people in the US who predict the end of society preach salvation through armed security. The fact is that these are the very people who pose the threat to society in the first place. The next WACO may not be religious nutters but a political movement. A splinter group of the Klu Klux Klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example and holding several hundred children hostage. The only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent them arising. No other government in the world has faced such a situation. this is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power weaponry to become avaliable to any little Hitler or would be Messiah to set themselves up as dictator in their own little empire.

Your argument tries to paint the BATF critics as right-wing gun nuts, and just mixes up two issues. I am one of the BATF/FBI critics, and yet I am a liberal and just as anti-gun as you are. I just happen to believe that everyone has civil rights, even religious crazies. They're all human beings, not some nest of wasps that you're trying to exterminate. The BATF created the crisis situation by the way they handled the original raid. It was well known that Koresh regularly went jogging outside his property. He could have been served with a search warrant then. He could have been arrested if he had refused to comply. Instead officers armed with grenades invaded the property. This escalated into a shooting war with tragic deaths on both sides. Those were the first two mistakes: the bad judgment of asking for a no-knock warrant, and the bad and probably illegal way the already-unwise warrant was served. At this point, the situation escalated to where it was described as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis. That's when the government started covering their traces, sealing the warrant, revising their reported history of the incident, etc. Things were already building up to disaster. Now the government could have simply closed the supply routes and waited. But according to Janet Reno, that option had "never been seriously considered". So, supposedly because the agents were "frustrated and fatigued", and because there supposedly were no backups, they felt they had to go in. Now it's entirely possible that Koresh was responsible for the fire. If that's so, he deserves the blame for the deaths of the people in his compound. But the government's hands are far from clean. Their first raid demonstrated bad judgment plus contempt for the 4th amendment. The motivations for the second raid are just too unbelievable. And their coverup of the events of the first raid undermines their credibility in anything they do thereafter. We have only some very biased FBI agents' word for what happened. And please let's not turn this into a pro-gun vs. anti-gun discussion. Anti-gun people do not believe that gun-owners deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government agents. And Koresh's civil rights exist whether his guns were legal, illegal, illegal-but-should-have-been-legal, or whatever! -- Rob Strom, strom@watson.ibm.com, (914) 784-7641 IBM Research, 30 Saw Mill River Road, P.O.

In New England in 1800 the entire economy was based on the small family farm. Farm economy households were economically diversified, producing not only agricultural goods but also "manufactured" goods, especially cloth. Many farm women carded, spun, and/or wove, producing not only cloth for their own family but also to sell, generating extra income. But about this time the Industrial Revolution was underway in England and by the 1820's it had moved to the US, in both cases in the form of textile mills. These mills could produce cloth far more efficiently and cheaply than people at home. The result was that an important source of home income was wiped out and many of these women were compelled by economic circumstance to go to work in these same mills in Lowell, Mass, or Nashua, NH, where they worked 73 hour weeks in deafening, dangerous conditions, living regimented lives and being exposed to cotton-dust and infectious dis- eases due to the work. Now people didn't *HAVE* to buy the cheaper factory-made cloth. They were free to keep buying the home-made variety and support their local economy . . . > Things are designed in such a way that in order to go with the system >and make money, everything ELSE we care about goes to shit. . . . but (sorry for the cliche), "it takes two to tango". The big rich corporations achieved that wealth because we buy their stuff. It used to be the case that the business center of a town was also its social center. You KNEW the merchants you did business with or even local kids working behind the counter. You would see people on the street whom you knew and you could stop for a chat. Nowadays local merchants are going out of business and people shop at huge anonymous malls serving regional populations of hundreds of thousands or millions. You have no particular relationship with the companies you do business with, and feel no particular commitment to them, nor they to you. Major components of what defines a "com- munity" have been destroyed. On the other hand the products we buy at these malls are a lot cheaper due to economies of scale and foreign manufacture, and they are probably of better, or at least more consistent, quality. > I have to >constantly remind myself that the goal of human society is not to make >money.

Today's Boston Globe interviewed a former Unification Church leader who is now a consultant on cults. He said the FBI's approach was totally wrong. He said they should have tried to break down the BD's loyalty to Koresh through psychological means. Koresh's whole theology was based on an approaching confrontation with the forces of evil in the world and a seige mentality based on this. The Feds played into his hands **PERFECTLY**. By surrounding the compound with tanks and playing loud rock music and glaring lights at them they strongly reinforced Koresh's message that the outside world was evil and threatening. He said instead they should have set up a picnic atmosphere, and acted inviting and friendly. If they broadcast anything over PA systems it should have been loving relatives reflecting on pleasant events from the cult members' childhoods. The idea is to make the outside world and surrender seem like a pleasant, desirable alternative. Interesting comments. ---peter	2

The second fire starts in another tower which is similar to the first only two storeys high. The flag is on the left in the camera picture that shows this fire starting. Thus the camera pictures cleraly show the fire starting at two separate locations. The FBI report a third. I was not able to verify it from the videotape however someone else identified a fire shown to be starting behind the small tower in the second (flag on left) camera angle. The flames coming out of the building are yellow/orange. This is the normal colour for carbon compounds burning. The flames were those of a solid or confined liquid burning, not of a gas exploding. The explosion that occurs mid way along the building is certainly not an explosive though. The cloud itself is on fire. This would seem to be most likely to be some sort of fuel oil store exploding rather than the explosion of a magazine. |>Funny, how considering there was to be a great cache of explosives |>ammunition, etc in the compound, I did not see any series of explosions. Depends entirely on how they were distributed. You would not be able to identify ammunition rounds going off from video camera coverage from a mile away.

If anyone expects to see explosions hollywood style aka Rambo movies then remember that in real life cars do not burst into flames when going over cliffs. Just about the most you could expect would be to see the grenades going off.

EDT THE PRESIDENT: Terry, do you have a question? Q Mr. President, there's a growing feeling that the Western response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate. Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something, anything to stop the fighting. Is the United States considering taking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery sites? THE PRESIDENT: Well, first let me say, as you know, for more than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for further action. And I want to say, too, let's look at the last three months. Since I became President I have worked with our allies and we have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on enforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes investigation, on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace process. We have made some progress. And now we have a very much tougher sanctions resolution. And Leon Fuerth, who is the National Security Advisor to the Vice President, is in Europe now working on implementing that. That is going to make a big difference to Serbia. And we are reviewing other options. I think we should act. We should lead -- the United States should lead. We have led for the last three months. We have moved the coalition. And to be fair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part. And they have troops on the ground there. But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, nor do I think we will have to. And in the next several days I think we will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and which has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the administration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so. I think we'll finish that in the near future and then we'll have a policy and we'll announce it and everybody can evaluate it. Q Can I follow up? THE PRESIDENT: Sure. Q Do you see any parallel between the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust? THE PRESIDENT: I think the Holocaust is on a whole different level. I think it is without precedent or peer in human history. On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of inhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree. The idea of moving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely because of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing. And it is especially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic groups live side by side for so long together. And I think you have to stand up against it. I think it's wrong. We were talking today about all of the other troubles in that region. I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and the Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning, and I think we're making progress on that front. But what's going on with the Serbians and the ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other conflicts, both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of the region. Q Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a good week in your presidency. The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of your stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia. What did you do wrong and what are you going to do differently? How do you look at things? Are you reassessing? (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: I don't really believe that the situation in Bosnia -- it's not been a good week for the world, but I don't know that the administration could have made it different. On the stimulus package, I'd like to put it into the larger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already fundamentally changed the direction of an American government. We have abandoned trickle-down economics. We've abandoned the policies that brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion in only a decade. The budget plan, which passed the Congress, which will reduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low in mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates. There are probably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages in the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit. That's going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this economy in ways that are very, very good for the country. And so we are moving in the right direction economically. I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have begun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the administration, but people in the Congress whether there is something I could have done differently to pass that. Part of the reason it didn't pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas. There are really people still who believe that it's not needed. I just disagree with that. I think the recovery -- the economists say it's been underway for about two years, and we've still had 16 months of seven- percent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having trouble creating jobs. So I think there was an idea base -- an argument there, that while we're waiting for the lower interest rates and the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years to take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go forward. Now, I have to tell you, I did misgauge that because a majority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted for a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983, and voted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this. I just misgauged it. And I hope that I can learn something. I've just been here 90 days. And, you know, I was a Governor working with a contentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get political reform there. So it takes time to change things. But I basically feel very good about what's happened in the first 100 days with regard to the Congress. Q Waco -- THE PRESIDENT: Well, with regard to Waco I don't have much to add to what I've already said. I think it is a -- I want the situation looked into. I want us to bring in people who have any insights to bear on that. I think it's very important that the whole thing be thoroughly gone over. But I still maintain what I said from the beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh. And I do not think the United States government is responsible for the fact that a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves. And I'm sorry that they killed their children. Q Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your stimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross Perot said today that you're playing games with the American people in your tax policy. He was strongly critical of your stimulus package. He said he's going to launch an advertising campaign against the North American Free Trade Agreement. How are you going to handle his political criticism? Will it complicate your efforts on the Hill with your economic plan? And do you plan to repackage some of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to resubmit them to the Hill? THE PRESIDENT: Let me answer that question first. We're going to revisit all of that over the next few days. I'm going to be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can do about that. With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found that rather amazing. I don't want to get into an argument with Mr. Perot. I'll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I would -- go back and read his book and his plan. There's a remarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts, we raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy. But, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar. So I think it would be -- I'll be interested to see if maybe perhaps he's changed his position from his book last year and he has some new ideas to bring to bear. I'll be glad to hear them. Q To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his political criticism? He's launched a campaign against you. Do you think you can sit back and just -- THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I will ask you to apply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me. And if he's changed his position from the positions he took in the campaign last year, then we need to know why and what his ideas are. Maybe he's got some constructive ideas. I think the American people have shown that they're very impatient with people who don't want to produce results. And the one thing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- even if they don't agree with what I do -- is that I want to get something done. I just came here to try to change things. I want to do things. And I want to do things that help people's lives. So my judgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is constructive, that takes us beyond some idea I've proposed that will change people's lives for the better, fine. But I think that that ought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this debate and not just to the President. Q Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute. You continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a criteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many options thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of paralysis. The United States is the last remaining superpower. Why is it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act unilaterally? THE PRESIDENT: Well, the United States -- surely you would agree, that the United States, even as the last remaining superpower, has to act consistent with international law under some mandate of the United Nations. Q But you have a mandate and -- THE PRESIDENT: They do, and that is one of the things that we have under review. I haven't ruled out any option for action. I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option, except that we have not discussed and we are not considering the introduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there. We are not. So we are reviewing other options. But I also would remind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the British and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there. They have been justifiably worried about those. But they have supported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions. They welcomed the American delegation now in Europe, working on how to make these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia. And I can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely reassessing their position, and I would not rule out the fact that we can reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where we have been. I don't have any criticism of the British, the French and others about that. Q Would that be military action? Q Mr. President, several of the leading lights in your administration, ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N. Ambassador, to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services Secretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which are absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you've taken in your administration. Why is that? Are you losing your political grip? THE PRESIDENT: Give me an example. Q Example? Judge Sessions said that there was no child abuse in Waco. Madeleine Albright has said in this morning's newspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in Bosnia. All of these are things you said that you didn't support. THE PRESIDENT: First of all, I don't know what -- we know that David Koresh had sex with children. I think that is undisputed, is it not? Is it not? Does anybody dispute that? Where I come from that qualifies as child abuse. And we know that he had people teaching these kids how to kill themselves. I think that qualifies as abuse. And I'm not criticizing Judge Sessions because I don't know exactly what he said. In terms of Madeleine Albright, Madeleine Albright has made no public statement at all about air strikes. There is a press report that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed her -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new direction we should take in response to my request to all the senior members of my administration to let me know what they thought we ought to do next. And I have heard from her and from others about what they think we ought to do next. And I'm not going to discuss the recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when I make a decision about what to do, then I will announce what I'm going to do. So I wouldn't say that either one of those examples qualifies speaking out of school. Q How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President? THE PRESIDENT: What was that? Q The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala both said that they thought that that was a good idea. THE PRESIDENT: I don't mind them saying they think it's a good idea. There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy grounds. That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it in the health care debate. No decision has been made on that. And I have no objection to their expressing their views on that. We've had a lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they thought that tax would help make their particular industries more competitive in the global economy. I took no -- that wasn't taking a line against an administration policy. Q Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and lesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed in the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of them and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would fulfill those aspirations. Do you feel now that you will be able to meet their now enhanced expectations? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don't know about that. And I don't know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are. But I'll tell you this: I believe that this country's policies should be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination. I believe when you tell people they can't do certain things in this country that other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and compelling reason for it. I believe we need the services of all of our people, and I have said that consistently. And not as a political proposition. The first time this issue came up was in 1991 when I was in Boston. I was just asked the question about it. And I might add -- it's interesting that I have been attacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily coming from the political right in America. When I was Governor, I was attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights of religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to practice home schooling under appropriate safeguards. I just have always had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect the rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest of their capacities, and I'm going to stick right with that. Q Are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated expectations on their end and criticism among others that has hamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis on this issue? THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but I have not placed a great deal of emphasis on it. It's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters and in the press. I've just simply taken my position and tried to see it through. And that's what I do. It doesn't take a lot of my time as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do, and that's what I'll continue to do. Q Mr. President, getting back to the situation in Bosnia -- and we understand you haven't made any final decisions on new options previously considered unacceptable. But the two most commonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable the Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited air strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines. Without telling us your decision -- presumably, you haven't made any final decisions on those two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going through your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final decision? THE PRESIDENT: I'm reluctant to get into this. There are -- those are two of the options. There are some other options that have been considered. All have pluses and minuses; all have supporters and opponents within the administration and in the Congress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be required to embark on any new policy. I do believe that on the air strike issue, the pronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military action, apply there. If you take action, if the United States takes action, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met. We must be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear. The United States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a war. With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the question obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace? Will it lead to more bloodshed? What kind of reaction can others have that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy? But I think both of them deserve some serious consideration, along with some other options we have. Q Do you think that these people who are trying to get us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven't taken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and we couldn't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from Vietnam? And now many of them are coming up with bills for treatment of Agent Orange. How can we afford to go to any more of these wars? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think that's a good argument against the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent in a war there. But we are, after all, the world's only super power. We do have to lead the world and there is a very serious problem of systematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, which could have not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and goodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other practical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts of ethnic tensions exist. Q Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris Yeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive action against the Serbs until after Sunday? And in general, how has his political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia? THE PRESIDENT: No, I have not made any agreement, and he did not ask for that. We never even discussed that, interestingly enough. The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President Yeltsin's campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher sanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper decision for them and one that the United States and, I'm sure, the rest of the free world very much appreciated. Q Do you wish, Mr. President, that you'd become more involved in the planning of the Waco operation? And how would you handle that situation differently now? THE PRESIDENT: I don't think as a practical matter that the President should become involved in the planning of those kinds of things at that detail. One of the things that I'm sure will come out when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and answered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions we should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten? And I look forward to that. But at the time, I have to say, as I did before, the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed, once we knew that the FBI was going to go in, was to ask that the military be consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the conflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and their obvious willingness to use them. And then on the day before the action, I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I have reported to you previously, and which at the time I thought were sufficient. I have -- as I said, I'm sure -- I leave it to others to make the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should have asked. Q Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director Sessions' role in the Waco affair? And have you made a decision on his future? And if you haven't, will you give him a personal hearing before you do decide? THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I have no assessment of his role since I had no direct contact with him. And I mean no negative or positive inference. I have no assessment there. I stand by what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI. And I'm waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what to do with the direction of the FBI. Q Mr. President, since you said that one side in Bosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to the nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot take a partisan view in this war? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I said that the principle of ethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against. That does not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter a war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of republics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately be successful. I think what the United States has to do is to try to figure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the people to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop ethnic cleansing. And that is obviously the difficulty we are wrestling with. This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy problem we face, and that all of our allies face. And if it were easy, I suppose it would have been solved before. We have tried to do more in the last 90 days than was previously done. It has clearly not been enough to stop the Serbian aggression, and we are now looking at what else we can do. Q Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt administration for not having bombed the railroads to the concentration camps and things that were near military targets. Aren't there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct conflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider? THE PRESIDENT: There may be. I would remind you that the circumstances were somewhat different. We were then at war with Germany at the time and that's what made that whole incident so -- series of incidents -- so perplexing. But we have -- as I say, we've got all of our options under review. Q The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge of collapse. What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale military operation? THE PRESIDENT: Well, you may know something I don't. That's not what our people tell me. I think Mr. Caputo and Ambassador Pezzullo have done together a good job. The thing keeps going back and forth because of the people who are involved with the de facto government there. It's obvious what their concerns are. They were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the first place, and President Aristide, we feel, should be restored to power. We're working toward that. I get a report on that -- we discuss it at least three times a week, and I'm convinced that we're going to prevail there and be successful. I do believe that there's every reason to think that there will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to guarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on both sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of ongoing civilized society. But I believe we're going to prevail there. Q Mr. President, would you care to make your assessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you? (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'll say if -- I believe, first of all, we passed the budget resolution in record time. That was the biggest issue. That confirmed the direction of the administration and confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both bring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do it by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of which come from the highest income people in this society --reversing a 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the middle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were going up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the total national debt, and the deficit continued to go up. We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages. We have lower interest rates across the board. We have tens of billions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people refinance their debt. We have established a new environmental policy, which is dramatically different. The Secretary of Education has worked with me and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach in education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing opportunity. We have done an enormous amount of work on political reform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform. And I have imposed tough ethics requirements on my own administration's officials. These things are consistent with not only what I said I'd do in the campaign, but with turning the country around. The Vice President is heading a task force which will literally change the way the federal government operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens of this country. We are working on a whole range of other things. The welfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work. And, of course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care issue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for millions of Americans. So I think it is amazing how much has been done. More will be done. We also passed the Family Leave bill. A version of the motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to me yet. And everything has been passed except the stimulus program. So I think we're doing fine and we're moving in the right direction. I feel good about it. Q Sir, a follow-up. Wouldn't you say, though, that one of your biggest initiatives, aid to Soviet Russia, is now practically finished -- if we can't pass a stimulus bill in our own country, how can we do it for them? THE PRESIDENT: Let me recast the question a little bit. It's a good question -- (laughter) -- it's a good question, but to be fair we've got to recast it. We have already -- the first round of aid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia, to a democratic Russia, is plainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion. The aid that we agreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the international financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is plainly going to go through. The question is, can we get any more aid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States Congress? And that is a question I think, Mary, that will be resolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the American workers and their jobs and their future. I think the two things will be tied by many members of Congress. Q The tailhook report came out this morning, documenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the Navy. How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done about it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy? THE PRESIDENT: First, let me comment a little on that. The Inspector General's report details conduct which is wrong and which has no place in the armed services. And I expect the report to be acted on in the appropriate way. I also want to say to the American people and to all of you that the report should be taken for what it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to be thoroughly examined. It should not be taken as a general indictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who serve there. It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be pursued. The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the Navy and the only thing I should have said to him, I think, is that I expected him to take the report and to do his duty. And I believe he will do that. Q Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute. The latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of confidence. But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not voters are going to endorse his economic reforms. THE PRESIDENT: I understand that. Q Can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you live with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in order to then build support for Russian aid? THE PRESIDENT: I believe -- the answer to your question is, for the United States, the key question should be that which is posed to any democracy, which is who wins the election. If he wins the election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as their President, then I think we should do our best to work with him toward reform. You know, we had a lot of other countries here for the Holocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here. Leaders from Eastern Europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former Soviet Union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they convert from a communist command and control economy to a market economy in a world where there's economic slowdown everywhere. And in a world in which there's economic slowdown and difficulty, all leaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll because they haven't produced the results that the people so earnestly yearn for. You can understand that. But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think that's all we can ask. And the United States will -- if the Russian people ratify him as their President and stick with him then the United States will continue to work with him. I think he is a genuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform. I think that we should support that. Q Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly in what is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement -- NAFTA. How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement and when do you expect to see it accomplished? THE PRESIDENT: I think we'll have the agreement ready in the fairly near future. You know, our people are still working with the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side agreements. We're trying to work out what the environmental agreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what the fairest way to deal with enforcement is. The Mexicans say, and there is some merit to their position, that they're worried about transferring their sovereignty in enforcement to a multilateral commission. Even in the United States, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that -- about giving that up. On the other hand, if we're going to have an environmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means something, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for violating them. So what we're trying to do is to agree on an approach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations -- if you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an isolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be some enforcement. There must be consequences. And we're working out the details of that. But I still feel quite good about it. And this is just an area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others. I think that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more closely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us from there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America, and gives us a bigger world in which to trade. I think that's the only way a rich country can grow richer. If you look at what Japan and other countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own region, it's a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry about how to build those bridges in our own area. So this is an idea battle. You know, you've got a lot of questions and I want to answer them all, but let me say not every one of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you know, who's for this and who's for that, and if this person is for this, somebody else has got to be for that. A lot of these things honestly involved real debates over ideas, over who's right and wrong about the world toward which we're moving. And the answers are not self-evident. And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for President is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating these ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way. So I just have a difference of opinion. I believe that the concept of NAFTA is sound, even though, as you know, I thought that the details needed to be improved. Q Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of interest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to show that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners. General Vessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was authentic, he believes that it was incorrect. Do you have a personal view at this point about that issue? And more broadly, do you believe that, in fact, the Vietnamese did return all the American prisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord? THE PRESIDENT: First let me say, I saw General Vessey before he went to Vietnam and after he returned. And I have a high regard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country in this way. As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let me say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it had been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to undermine the validity of the Russian documents claim. I do not know whether that is right or wrong. We are having it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the evaluation, we'll tell you. And, of course, we want to tell the families of those who were missing in action or who were POWs. I think that we'll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of the questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last interchange, but I cannot say that I'm fully satisfied that we know all that we need to know. There are still some cases that we don't know the answer to. But I do believe we're making some progress. I was encouraged by the last trip. Q I'd like to follow up on that. Before the U.S. normalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be personally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be willing to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to resolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to us to confirm good faith? THE PRESIDENT: A lot of experts say you can never resolve every case, every one, that we couldn't resolve all the cases for them and that there are still some cases that have not been factually resolved, going back to the Second World War. But what I would have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward resolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time, and that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to continue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving those cases. And we're not there yet. Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who know a lot about this. And I confess to being much more heavily influenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there, or whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and the other things which seem so compelling in this moment. I just am very influenced by how the families feel. Q your economic stimulus package, are you doing some kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans, your legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill, the health care initiative and other things? Are there any plans to do that? And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob Dole? THE PRESIDENT: No, what I underestimated was the extent to which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly after we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress, including the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when we had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500 billion in deficit reduction. When they had voted repeatedly for supplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, I thought at least four of them would vote to break cloture, and I underestimated that. I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that. I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to negotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed. Instead, every time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had previously been talking to the Majority Leader about. So it was a strange set of events. But I think what happened was what was a significant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired a political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so that a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately, "Mr. President, I'd like to be for this, but I can't now. And we're all strung out and we're divided." And I think we need to do a reality check. As I said, what I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want to know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and Republicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to make it come out differently. Because the real losers here were not the President and the administration. The real losers were the hundreds of thousands of people who won't have jobs now. We could have put another 700,000 kids to work this summer. I mean, we could have done a lot of good things with that money. And I think that is very, very sad. And it became more political than it should have. But the underlying rationale I don't think holds a lot of water -- that it was deficit spending. That just won't wash. Q and redo -- THE PRESIDENT: No. I mean, you know, for example --you mentioned the crime bill. I think it would be a real mistake not to pass the crime bill. I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point of passage last year. And they were all fighting over the Brady Bill. Surely, surely after what we have been through in this country just in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we have seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a waiting period before they buy a handgun. And surely we can see that we need more police officers on the street. That's another thing that -- I really believe that once we move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this jobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the street who'd been laid off, that would be a compelling case. I mean people are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward. I feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill. Q Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a second. That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy's senior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior officers. Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated in this, including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las Vegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a right to know the names of the senior officers? THE PRESIDENT: You should know that under the rules of law which apply to this, I am in the chain of command. There is now an Inspector General's report and the law must take its course. If I were to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which might be later made in this case. I don't really think -- I think all I can tell you is what I have already said. I was very disturbed by the specific allegations in the Inspector General's report, and I want appropriate action to be taken. Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and appropriate action is taken, I have been advised that because I am the Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so as not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action might proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or con. So I can't say any more except to say that I want this thing handled in an appropriate and thorough way. Q Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification on Bosnia? You said that you were not considering introduction of American forces. Does that include any air forces as well as ground forces, sir? THE PRESIDENT: I said ground forces. Q You said ground forces. Could I ask you, sir, if you fear that using U.S. air strikes might draw the United States into a ground war there? THE PRESIDENT: I just don't want to discuss our evaluation of the options anymore. I've told you that there's never been a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of ground forces into an ongoing conflict there. Q With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington this weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to leave town for this weekend? Did you ever consider in any way participating in some of the activities? THE PRESIDENT: No. Q Why not? THE PRESIDENT: Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn't participate in other marches. I think once you become President, on balance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should be done. But more importantly, I'm going to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me to make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental issues at stake for our country right now. And I expect that I will say something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here, asking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking, basically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be treated like other American citizens if they do that, and just that. And that's always been my position -- not only for the gays who will be here, but for others as well. Thank you very much. END1:48 P.M. EDT	2

15	From: daveb@pogo.wv.tek.com (Dave Butler) Subject: Objectivity (was: After 2000 years...) Organization: Tektronix, Inc., Wilsonville, OR. Lines: 83 This discussion on "objective" seems to be falling into solipsism (Eg: the recent challenge from Frank Dwyer, for someone to prove that he can actually observe phenomena). Someones even made the statement that science is "subjective" and that even atom are "subjective." This is getting a bit silly and the word "objective" is losing all meaning. Lets start by remembering the definition of "objective" which has been already presented: objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence. 3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on observable phenomenon. The Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that thing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that there exist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable phenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mental processes, etc). Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable phenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. Even weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though that observation can change the outcome). Nor are those observable phenomenon affected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not change to the whims of different people). Thus to say that science is not objective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the point of science. Now I will agree that science is not objectively "good;" I will not thereby conclude though that science is not objective. Now some examples things which are "objective": A D-12 tractor is larger than the average breadbox. Chlorophyll is green. Seawater contains salt. There exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently). Ozone blocks ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer. "Good" on the other hand is a value judgement. It doesn't seem to have an existence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the existence of an omnipotent entity which has defined "good"). We cannot quantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bag full of "good"). Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word "good" an objective meaning, e.g. "good" has been used to denote strength, resiliency, speed, etc. That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see "strength" and etc, as necessarily "good" (eg: strength inspired by Naziism is not generally viewed as "good"). As to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based on verifiable observable phenomenon. The closest I have seen is some form of the "Golden Rule," which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss people off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in a manner you won't like. This is verifiable; when you "get in someone's face," they will often retaliate. Another objective fact about morality is that a more powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus can at times, ignore that form of the "Golden Rule" without fear of reprisal. Now as to whether this enforcing of morality is "good" or "bad," is quite subjective. By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thing cannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means that that it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physical existence unto itself. Also note that I have not stated that there is no such thing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such a morality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such morality. One other thing to notice, "objective" is many times used as synonymous with "true" and/or "absolute," and "subjective" sometimes has the connotation of "false" and/or "relative." Tain't necessarily so. For instance, when a conclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can be both objective and false. As to "absolute," it is easy to note that while we can objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely mean that all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absolute either. On the other hand, something subjective can also be either "absolutist," or "true." For instance, there are some theists who are specifically "absolutist" in their morality, even though they have only subjective evidence to back it up. Further, many a scientist and detective has been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a "gut feeling" or "hunch"), to investigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidence necessary to support a true hypothesis. On the whole though, I would have to agree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective evidence. Later, Dave Butler In starting any thesis, it seems to me, one should put forward as one's point of departure something incontrovertible; the expression should be simple and dignified. Diogenes	3

Even a little child will rebelliously stick his finger in a light socket. Even a little child will not want his diaper changed. Even a little child will fight nap-time. So far as Jesus saying "everyone": A certain ruler asked Jesus, "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" "Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good-- except God alone." Ken, the book of Romans states that we are born sinners. We do not grow into being a sinner. We sin because we are sinners. The common mistake, even in Christian circles, is to think the reverse true. So for as surely as you grew to look like you parents, you not only inherited their appearance, but also their sin nature. It goes with being human. Even though a new-born is innocent as can be, his sinful nature will surely manifest itself more explicity as he gets older. For as surely as he grows hair on his head and teeth within his mouth, he will show the signs of his innate sin by rebelling against mommy and daddy with that loud proclamation "No."	3

25	From: mls@panix.com (Michael Siemon) Subject: commandments I (the basics) Organization: PANIX Public Access Unix, NYC Lines: 205 Why should anyone (check: let's restrict this to Christians, why do *we*) want to find "commandments" in the books regarded as scripture? What's going on? I will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more open) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is the *theological* point involved? And it has been quoted "at" me often enough by those who don't believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is said to have) said, "If you love me, you will obey my commands." [John 14:15] I am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that I should do as He wills me to do. I am (also, or instead) His younger brother, but still under His direction, though we both call God "Abba." Christians, therefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, and discovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure. Readers here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as "slaves of Christ") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts (whether classified as "inspired" or not) that are held up as models, in an effort to find application to their own situations. This practice ranges from "devotional" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon- ical scripture as "the Word of God." And at the highest pitch, this leads to a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that can act as "absolute" guidance for our actions. The problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands. I am going to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians have looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition. That is not because *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay is Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the witness of Scripture. The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments can we find from our Lord in Scripture? And that turns out to be a hard question. [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the discussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike *most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason and c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ] Earlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] "I give you a new commandment: love one another." This is the ONLY place in the NT where Christians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting on its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus. At the same meal [so we *readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus says, "Take this [bread]; this is my body." [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26, Luke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24] The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_), and hence this, too, is a "commandment." In *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider circle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the evangelist's point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or entirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment from our Lord. In the case of communion, Paul's mention (at least; this is probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy in which these words operate to "bind" Christians to the original command to his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community. I am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that it is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command. I take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST'S notion, that *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus' command directed at the disciples. But I have to call attention to the inference. The command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific context of its statement to my own context as a "disciple" of Christ. All reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out of the text whatsoever. This is a general problem in reading these texts -- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native languages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without *some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original languages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows, that we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control [ I don't *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current purposes. ] I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already coped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world than the one we live in. Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser- vations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we can read the texts as the original audience might have done. Among the reasons we have for seeing John's _agapate allelou_ as a *general* commandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that one occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic "Great Commandment" is that we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom we congenially associate with. In Matthew 5:43ff we read, "You have learnt how it was said: 'You must love your neighbor' and hate your enemy. But I say to you: love your enemies." In fact, the Leviticus context quoted does NOT say 'hate your enemy' -- it is merely the common human presumption. (And Leviticus is at pains to say that the "love" should extend to strangers amongst the people of Israel.) Luke, in expanding on this same Q context, goes on to have Jesus say. "Even sinners love those who love them." [6:27] All of this suggests [quite strongly, I'd say :-)] that *limiting* the scope of the "new commandment" is not quite what Jesus has in mind. In short, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command that is "in force" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other Christians. Trickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is the case of the "Great Commission" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve are sent out to evangelize, "Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand." The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather specific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in "Do not turn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town" -- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus' final journey to Jerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians than the previous examples. That hasn't prevented Christians from MAKING such an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference is NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by the rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader. Still, Paul seems to have felt obliged to "proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand" even (contrary to Jesus' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to the ends of the earth. So, Christians after him have also taken this as a "commandment" in the sense of John 14:15. Do I "accept" this? I don't know. It is surely rather speculative. But you see how the ripples of inference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may) infer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in the gospels as a specific occasion. I do not (necessarily) object to this kind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must* have an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable length) from what we actually *have* in scripture. There are *assumptions* involved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural (though people will do their best to "justify" their assumptions by OTHER references to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!) Let's move on to the "Great Commandment" -- that we should love God with our whole hearts and minds and souls. This is, perhaps, the Synoptic "equivalent" of John's _agapate allelou_. And yet, it is not PRESENTED as a commandment, in our texts. Rather, the context is controversy with the Pharisees. To cite Matthew [22:34ff] "But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees they got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question, "Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?" It is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus' answer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*. He is answering a polemic from his enemies. [ Mark's account, in 12:28-34 casts the answer in a far more positive light as (so the "scribe" in this version says) "far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word originates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this) or sacrifice." Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question "to disconcert" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains [ Luke 10:25-37 ]. The contexts here are so confusingly various that one could be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-) In *no* account is this said as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on Christians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each case that Jesus thinks it to be so. The point is that our mental gears HAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about what WE are commanded to do, by Jesus. And all of this is contingent on our understanding the point of Jesus' use of the Torah in the (all quite different) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*. The different contexts among the Synoptics are curious. It should be noted that ONLY in Luke do we get the "fixing" of this command by the parable of the Good Samaritan. We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where 7:12 gives the "Golden Rule" as "the meaning of the Law and the Prophets" (and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation before Jesus.) If we make these associations (which I think are entirely reasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference. The texts do not *explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of inter-relationship. Current literary theory calls this "intertextuality." My discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ "has" to apply beyond the community of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers, applies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the presentation not saying so explicitly) a "commandment" to Christians. Few Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point out that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains of reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves. The contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at those sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as commandments. And we get some really hard cases. Take divorce. Mark is pretty clear, "The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty of adultery against her." [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew has an escape clause [ "except in the case of fornication", 5:31 ]. This seems to be a rather clear "commandment" (whether or not we take Matthew's reservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so. But some don't, at least in practice. This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were not explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the things people gnash their teeth over.) How is it possible, if the commands of Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists of the synoptic tradition? I'm going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this is enough to start with. The theme is: "finding commandments in scripture is an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions, that is, our own cultural biases." I have, so far, identified a very few "commandments" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in these, already, some of the difficulties start to surface. It is these difficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic. The divorce commandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no evidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn *me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or misc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that US law refuse to allow it, or refuse "unrepentant divorcees" places in their churches. [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn't* enter into consideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in even the most "liberal" church circles. For example, a (wildly) liberal Episcopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has recommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a "private" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the "public" ceremony he celebrated need not go through an agonizing "examination" by officials who would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands we are faced with as Christians. This, in a church that was effectively CREATED by a famous divorce! ] -- Michael L.

I realize it is > normally tossed out because it contains miracles, but what > are the other reasons? Far from being "tossed out," the gospels are taken, almost universally, as the primary source of information about Jesus. I am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring. Who "tosses out" the New Testament? Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this, but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb ascribes this more broadly. Perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is why, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far outnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels *not* taken as "gospel truth" that faithfully records just what happened two thousand years ago? This has an easy answer, and the answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken this way by a critical reader. There is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text, measures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the text as "historically valid" or "tosses out" the text. I suspect this myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and secondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority, and from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present historical arguments along these lines for their religious program. In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary school history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better such texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed above, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if it bit him on the keister twice. Let me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts and their use in studying history. First, all texts are historically valid. ALL texts. Or to put this another way, I have never seen a notion of "historical validity" that makes any sense when applied to a text. Second, no text should be read as telling the "gospel truth" about historical events, in the way that many students are wont to read history texts in primary and secondary school. NO text. (This includes your favorite author's history of whatever.) Every text is a historical fact. Every text was written by some person (or some group of people) for some purpose. Hence, every text can serve as historical evidence. The question is: what can we learn from a text? Of what interesting things (if any) does the text provide evidence? The diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, are historical evidence. The gospels are historical evidence. The letters of the officers who participated in the vampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence. The modern American history textbooks that whitewash "great American figures" are historical evidence. These are all historical evidence of various things. They are *not* much evidence at all that the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that Jesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that "great American figures" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school. They are better evidence that some people "saw" the Maharishi, late of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians thought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe "saw" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather than teach history. How does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of historical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces? This is a very complex question that has no easily summarized answer. There are many books on the subject or various parts of the subject. I enjoy David Hackett Fischer's "Historian's Fallacies" as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy to read texts present history. It's relatively cheap. It's easy to read. Give it a try. Russell	3

The man-made laws are NOT working. "WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE!" Perpetrators remain IGNORANT of The LAW--a universal, cosmic, and Spiritual Law--The "LAW of RETRIBUTION" or "KARMA": "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." Galatians 6:7, KJV. "He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity; he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and faith of the saints." Revelation 13:10, KJV. "What goes around comes around." This LAW of the Universe is just as real as the physical law that for every action there is an equal and opposite REaction. It is the ENFORCEMENT, the TEETH, behind The "GOLDEN RULE": "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you." ALL perpetrators in the present will become VICTIMS in the future, most likely in a FUTURE INCARNATION. Most victims in the present were PERPETRATORS in the past, usually during a PREVIOUS LIFE. What is needed is a MASSIVE WORLDWIDE PROGRAM of EDUCATION to teach ALL present and potential perpetrators, in a convincing manner (with sufficient supporting evidence), that what they do to others WILL BE DONE TO THEM, in this life or the next. Anyone who doubts the FACT of REINCARNATION, and the related "LAW of Retribution", should read books such as "HERE AND HEREAFTER", by Ruth Montgomery, which describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSION to past lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind can sometimes make things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experiences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while traveling there for the first time on vacation), the psychic readings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED BEFORE?!). Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES. For example, a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE. And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to another person being met for the first time in their PRESENT life, because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS INCARNATION. People would behave much better toward each other if they knew that their actions in the present will SURELY be reaped by them in the future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION!

Did you know that according to the Bible, there shouldn't even be such things as "priests" anymore?

I had an ehum, interesting experience with the Rosicrucians, or at least Rosicrucians of some sort last Sunday. They had advertised that they were holding a lecture titled The Graal of the King -- the room of the heart (which rhymes in Swedish). Out of curiosity, I went to the lecture. There were four people there apart from the two Rosicrucians, one woman and two men apart from me. The Rosicrucians were male, both of them. First one of them told us about the Rosicrucians and Lectorium Rosicrucianum, which was founded in Harlem, NL in 1925. He read straight from a piece of paper, which I at that point was because he lacked experience in talking in front of people, but the other guy read, too, and he was used to holding speeches, I could tell. The first guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars (English?) from the thirteenth century. The other guy took over, reading from his piece of paper in a fairy-tale teller's voice. What he said sounded like a load of crap to me. Of course that might be because I am unenlightened or something. What made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all contained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity, then that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently, but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss. Maybe I've read too much RAW, but it sounded very much like the things he talks about in the chapter _How to robotize people and brainwash your friends_ in _Prometheus rising_. It was very interesting to watch the two Rosicrucians. The one holding the actual lecture, obviously was top dog, and the other one seemed to be a true believer. I got the impression that the top dog had more distance to the faith than the true believer, that he used it to gain power and admiration.

So Albert Sabin is the common ancestor of several threads, some of which have themselves speciated. On a separate topic, I subscribed to t.o. just recently. Albert Sabin existed at that time, so I have no clue as to its origins. Maybe the abiogenesists have an answer. I might also point out that evolution is aimless.

Well, if our observer X is as likely to be in A's position as B's, and if he agrees that both A and B are making appropriate observations and inferences regarding the situation, then I would expect him to conclude that there is no right answer. Hopefully there would be some other factor which would allow him to make some judgement regarding which answer to accept. If, on the other hand, he disagrees with the principles of either A or B, I suspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one. It is unfortunately the case that not all moral arguments have answers from all perspectives. For instance, I am completely unable to come to any conclusion regarding whether abortion should be allowed or not, from my perspective. In an ideal world, all living things would have a right to life; but in an ideal world, women would have the absolute right to do what they like with their own bodies. Clearly there is no way to resolve in favour of both these principles. Therefore I agree with the compromise solution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception, and deciding on the time based on various (sometimes ill-defined) criteria. This is also a sensible move, I think, because it lets people make their own decisions (within reason). And for what it's worth, I am reasonably happy with current UK abortion law. Similarly, the situation in what's left of Yugoslavia is a horrible mess, and I really can't see my way to any sort of conclusion. There, I don't even know enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage. mathew	3

This is true in exactly the same sense that as a philosophy Christians' disbelief in Zeus is worthless. Atheists construct their personal philosophies from many different sources, building non-god-based ideas in the same way as Christians build non-Zeus-based ideas of thunderbolts. Atheists no more *base* their philosophy on atheism than Christians base theirs on the nonexistence of Zeus. The "weak atheist" position is logically extremely assailable -- any logical demonstration of the existence of a god completely destroys it as soon as the demonstration is made in the presence of a given weak atheist. Atheists in this newsgroup are barraged regularly with attempts to provide such a logical demonstration, and they all fail miserably. In fact, most of the people around here who claim the "strong (as opposed to mathematical) atheist" position do so on this basis: not only do we not believe in a god, but also all the arguments presented in favor of particular gods have to date proven unsound; therefore, one can say that those gods as argued by those arguments do not exist. This doesn't apply to such philosophers' gods as are defined to be logically undemonstrable, but these are not the gods of popular religion, and the coherence of such claims is quite questionable. -- Jim Perry perry@dsinc.com Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC These are my opinions.

Lines: 117 Distribution: na NNTP-Posting-Host: cass.ma02.bull.com Russell Turpin, as is his wont, has raised some interesting issues in his struggle with the Christian texts and the Christians. Unfortunately, he seems to be hoping for simplicity where it is not available. The lukewarm stew he detects may well be an inevitable result of the divine mixing himself up with a bunch of losers such as humanity. Also unfortunately (perhaps) I have a deadline in two weeks, the responsibility for which prevents me, in good conscience, from writing a more considered response and fully entering the fray, as it were. Let me then say what I can, briefly. ----- >The two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are >so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.

Once again, we are confronted with good sounding >goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. This requires the assumption that all interpretations are equally valid, that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing among them. I wouldn't make that assumption; I don't think it is a reasonable assumption. >And who is to say that this interpretation is "twisted"? There >are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward >reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way. Michael, and I, and others, read 'the Bible' with Christian glasses. Among the things that this should imply is that the NT informs the OT, even to the point of dominanting it. Some points in the OT (ceremonial & dietary laws) are explicitly abrogated by the NT texts. To drive Russell Turpin's point with adequacy, one needs to begin with NT texts (probably from Matthew, and probably about damnation) (Just trying to help :-) ) This part is, I discover, what most moves me to post: mls> I am a "radical" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously. >No, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel >seriously. What differentiates you is the way you interpret the >gospel. Russell Turpin's 'No' here is misplaced, not to say inappropriate. Michael's self-description much govern. The equation of radical = liberal, which seems implied by Russell Turpin is wrong. Radical conservatives are possible (if sadly lacking in numbers at present). Thomas Merton was a radical, even though conservative in some ways. St Francis was a radical, similarly. How many examples are needed? mls> ... Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me mls> tell you something about Christianity? ... Michael's question gets to a heart of the matter (Klingons have two hearts, so my metaphor is not mixed, just extraterrestrial :-) ) Russell Turpin (in an earlier post) had said that Michael (Michael's theological positions, actually) didn't tell him much about Christianity; Dean Simeon responds (this time gently): 'What do you mean?' More direct, perhaps, would have been: 'What could you possibly mean?' The implied rhetorical effort, to separate Michael from the tradition, is a failure. Michael is in the tradition. If your idea of the tradition doesn't include him, Change your idea of the tradition! >The irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per >se that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and >gays. How can one answer this while staying on the more general issue? I'm on the other side of the interpretive fence (from Michael) on this issue, yet '*nothing*' is a hideous overstatement. One verse is enough to refute it; I'll offer two, from Paul (of all people): 'In Jesus Christ there is neither male nor female...'(Galatians 3:28 {I don't quote single verses as a rule, and I don't carry them in my head}) and '*Nothing* shall separate us from the glory of God...' (roughly, from Romans). [If Russell would promise to convert based on these or any other verses, I'd promise to get the full context for any that he requires :-) :-)] >In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that >make Michael's Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would >be as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by >Christian interpretation.

Hmm, it seems that this is the core of Christianity then, you have to feel guilty, and then there's this single personality that will save you from this universal guilt feeling. Brian, I will tell you a secret, I don't feel guilty at all, I do mistakes, and I regret them, however I've never had this huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder.

They wore make up and jewelry and the whole bit. Wow. Only other such primitive transsexualism I know of goes on in India (where else?) where they do that castration thing under some meditation maybe, I forget by now...there's a book on that.)

54	From: trajan@cwis.unomaha.edu (Stephen McIntyre) Subject: Theists And Objectivity Organization: University of Nebraska at Omaha Lines: 82 Can a theist be truly objective? Can he be impartial when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or will he assume the superstition of his parents when questioning? I've often found it to be the case that the theist will stick to some kind of superstition when wondering about God and his scriptures. I've seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim, and the other theists alike. All assume that their mothers and fathers were right in the aspect that a god exists, and with that belief search for their god. Occasionally, the theist may switch religions or aspects of the same religion, but overall the majority keep to the belief that some "Creator" was behind the universe's existence. I've known Muslims who were once Christians and vice versa, I've known Christians who were once Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known Christians who become Hindu. Yet, throughout their transition from one faith to another, they've kept this belief in some form of higher "being." Why? It usually all has to do with how the child is brought up. From the time he is born, the theist is brought up with the notion of the "truth" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible, the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc. He is told of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired) the scripture, of the prophets talked about in the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc. He is also told that to question this (as children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime against God, and to lose belief in the scrip- ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell. Thus, by the time he is able to read the scripture for himself, the belief in its "truth" is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a matter of course. But it doesn't stop there. Once the child is able to read for himself, there is an endeavor to inculcate the child the "right" readings of scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to explain away the unexplainable with "mystery." Circular arguments, "self-evdent" facts and "truths," unreasoning belief, and fear of hell is the meat of religion the child must eat of every day. To doubt, of course, means wrath of some sort, and the child must learn to put away his brain when the matter concerns God. All of this has some considerable effect on the child, so that when he becomes an adult, the superstitions he's been taught are nearly impossible to remove. All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can truly be objective when questioning God, Hell, Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest. Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that God *does* exist and look at everything from a unbiased point of view? Obviously, most theists can somewhat, especially when presented with "mythical gods" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian, & etc.). But can they put aside the assumption of God's existence and question it impartially?

Lines: 281 In article <1746.2BD37A66@paranet.FIDONET.ORG> Bill.Carlson@p0.f18.n104.z1.FIDONET.ORG (Bill Carlson) writes: > Since everywhere I look, Zoroaster is suggested as being a probable > descendant of Daniel; suppose you prove he wasn't. Zoroaster is far older than Daniel. If anything, one could claim that, in a sense, Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster; as Daniel, though being Hebrew, has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfully introduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism. [However, the majority of the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic (not Babylonian Aramaic) and only has Kethuvim or Writing status.] Ref: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade: DANIEL, or, in Hebrew, Daniyye'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name. Daniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in the royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his salvation from death in a lion's pit. He also appears in the last chapters of the book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel's restoration to national-religious autonomy. As a practitioner of oneiromancy in the court, described in Daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), Daniel per- forms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in Daniel 7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him decode his visions and mysteries of the future. It is likely that the name Daniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known from Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (Ez. 14:4,28:3). The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative voices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in Hebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic. The language division parallels the subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations; 7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). The overall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7 is chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. After the prefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some youths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a sequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn. 7-12). Much of this royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example, Daniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar's transformation into a beast, a story that is reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as the last king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Mede who conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no such Darius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name of several Persian kings). Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting a series of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of miraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth to mid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine providence and encourage steadfast faith. The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to that of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in Palestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior to the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jews were put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral traditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a martyr's death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. All of the visions of Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of the enthronement of a God of judgment, with a "son of man" invested with rule (this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians as Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre manifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient prophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12. The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four metals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth monarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur- vived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes to the end of the Middle Ages. The role and power of this imagery in the fifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, the scientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth Monarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimony to the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of diverse thinkers and groups. The schema is still used to this day by various groups predicting the apocalyptic advent. The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and propagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah 52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as the select faithful. Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor the final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather advocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation. Victory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and the martyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. Persumably the circles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may reflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. The themes of resistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic integrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of the God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of trust for the faithful in their darkest hour. ZARATHUSHTRA, founder of the religion know as Zoroastrianism or Mazdaism (from Mazda or Ahura Mazda, the name of the god prophesied by Zarathushtra.) The etymology and history of Zarathushtra, the Avestan and oldest form of the name, as uncertain, both in various Iranian languages and in related forms else- where. There may have been an Old Persian form, Zara-ushtra, from which the Greek form, Zoroastres, may be derived, and there may have existed an Old Iranian form, Zarat-ushtra, to which may be linked the Middle Iranian Zrdrwsht, several Middle Persian forms (such as Zrtwsht), and the New Persian Zardusht. We can state with certainty only that the second half of the name, ushtra, means "camel." The form Zoroaster, derived from the Greek Zoroastres, was used traditionally in European culture until the eighteenth century, when Zarathustra, closer to the original (and as found in Nietzsche), came into common use after the rediscovery of the Avesta, the collection of sacred books of Zoroastrianism, and the resulting studies in Iranian philology. [See Avesta.] Notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of Zarathushtra, even in Western culture, the sources available to us are few, extremely fragmented, and heterogeneous. Our principle sources are the five Gathas ("songs"), attributed to Zarathushtra himself and included in the Yasna section of the Avesta: Gatha Ahunavaiti (Yasna 28-34), Gatha Ushtavaiti (Yasna 43-46), Gatha Spentamainyu (Yasna 47-50), Gatha Vokukhshathra (Yasna 51), and Gatha Vashishtoishti (Yasna 53), the last of which was probably written after the prophet's death. Other sources of considerable, albeit varying, importance are the Younger Avesta and the remaining Zoroastrian religious literature, in particular the Pahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures CE. Although the Achaemenid inscriptions (sixth to fourth centures BCE) never mention Zarathushtra, he is mentioned by some Greek sources of the time (not, however, by Herodotus, who seems unaware of him). The Avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true chronological history of Zarathushtra. But the text is useful in an indirect way, as it clearly implies that the environment in which Zoroastrianism arose was not that of Iran under the Medes or the Persians. The Greek sources, on the other hand, do provide some information concerning the time of Zarathushtra, although from a historical point of view they are unreliable. Some place him six thousand years before the Trojan War (Xanthus of Lydia, Eudoxus of Cnidus, Hermippus, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and Pliny). The account by Xanthus of Lydia, however, has also been interpreted by some to mean six hundred, rather than six thousand, years before the expedition of Xerxes against Greece. This interpretation is favored by Diogenes Laertius, who makes reference to Xanthus, but although a few scholars (A. S. Shabazi, Helmut Humbach) have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts, it is generally rejected. Although the historical value of the Greek sources is negligible, they are nonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history of the cosmos had already been developed in Iran by the Achaemenid period, as the above account would seem to demonstrate. They also show that by this time Zarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure, one from an extremely distant past. All of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet could not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with, or even close to, that of the Achaemenids. Later Zoroastrian sources, the Pahlavi texts, do provide an absolute chrono- logy for Zarathushtra, one that was also accepted by some Arab authors. Accord- ing to these sources, Zarathushtra lived 300 or 258 years before Alexander. Again, scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology; some view it as historically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical justification. The most convincing arguments, however, seem to support the latter position. The figure of 258 years is accurate only on the surface because it represents, in fact, the more general one of 300, which was employed by Sasanid propagandists to locate Zarathushtra's lifetime roughly around the beginning of Iranian domination. For a number of reasons connected with complex problems inherent in the Iranian chronology, there was also a desire on the part of the Sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat. In this context, Zarathushtra, whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after the beginning of the cosmos, converted Vishtaspa at the age of forty-two, and Vishtaspa's conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium (thus explaining the double date of 300 and 258 years before Alexander). Given the unreliability of the few available sources, we are forced to reconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements, principally on the contention that Zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before Cyrus the Great, Cambyses, and Darius, as there is no mention in the Avesta of the great political achievements that took place in western Iran in the middle of the first millennium BCE. Nor is there any mention of the history of that period, which was to lead Iran to a position of such predominance. At the same time, for a number of reasons, going back much further in history would not be justified. Consequently, the traditionally accepted theory of placing Zara- thushtra around the beginning of the first millennium BCE appears to be the most legitimate. As to Zarathushtra's land of origin, many scholars agree, on the basis of valid arguments, that he must have come from eastern Iran. Some have held that he was a Mede, largely because of a late Iranian tradition linking Zarathushtra with Azerbaijan, but also because of linguistic reasons, based on the language of the Avesta. This hypothesis, however, should be discarded, as we can suppose, both on historical and linguistic grounds, that Zarathushtra came from the east, even though we do not know precisely from which region. There is a considerable variety of opinion on this particular matter, including the improbable view that he came from Chorasmia, or present-day Khorezm, or from a wider Chorasmian region, reaching as far as the oases of Merv and Herat. Most likely, however, Zarathushtra's land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the Hindu Kush mountain range to the more southern regions of Bactria and Arachosia (modern Qandahar), as well as Drangiana (the area of lake Helmand). It would thus be located in what is now Afghanistan or in the border regions of Iran. Zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste (Yasna 33.6). He was a zaotar (cf. Sanskrit hotr), that is, a priest belonging to a specific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned religious poetry. Even in the so-called Younger Avesta he is described as an athravan (Yashts 13.94), a more general term encompassing the entire priestly caste. To enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training, which he used to lend dignity (as in the Gathas) to the contents of his new message, the product of a great and original ethical mind. Zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition, linking India to Iran in another way, by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan, or "possessor of asha," that is, the one who, as in the Vedic rtavan, seeks truth and masters it, thus becoming ashavan in this life - almost an initiate - and blessed after death. Any good follower of such teachings seeks the "vision of asha," just as those chosing the right path in Vedic India aspired to the "vision of the Sun," a manifestation of rta. Behind these concepts and this language lies the great tradition of "Aryan mysticism," that is, of Indo-Iranian mysticism. Zarathushtra's greatness, however, does not lie in his having belonged to a particular religious tradition. Rather, it lies in the innovation and strength of his message, which was in itself a break in the tradition, one that force- fully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas: dualistic monotheism (the Wise Lord who fathers two twin spirits, the beneficent and the evil); and the expectation of a transfiguration (Av., Frashokereti; Pahl., Frashgird) of life and existence. [See Frashokereti] Both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological doctrine deeply separate Zarathushtra's teachings from the Indo-Iranian tradi- tions of his upbringing. They exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic and ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem of evil. Because of his basic tenets, Zarathushtra, who advocated an inward religiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi- tion, can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures. Another original facet of Zarathushtra's message, one that is not easy to understand but which, however, holds the key to a deeper understanding of the complex intellectual and poetic structure of the Gathas, is the doctrine of the Amesha Spentas, the "beneficent immortals." These are spiritualizations of the abstract notions of good thought, best truth, desirable power, bounteous devotion, wholeness, and immortality, all of which operate according to a system of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the manifestations of a divinity and of human virtue. [See Amesha Spentas.] Other than the names of his father, Pourushaspa ("possessing gray horses"), and of his mother, Dughdova ("one who has milked"), we know almost nothing of Zarathushtra's life. A late Pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers. According to tradition, Zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty, and at thirty he was subject to a revelation, both through an intense and powerful inspiration and through a vision. Only after ten years had passed, however, did he succeed in converting a cousin of his, Maidhyoimah, to his beliefs. He was strongly opposed in his native land by kavis, karapans, and usijs, priestly groups associated with traditional teachings and practices. This hostility caused him to leave his region (Yasna 46:1) and to seek refuge at the court of Kavi Vishtaspa, a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with his wife, Hutaosa, when the prophet, according to tradition, was forty-two years old. We also know the name of a son, Isat Vastra ("desiring pastures"), and of three daughters born of his first wife, as well as the names of two more sons, Urvatatnara ("commanding men") and Hvarecithra ("sun-faced"), born of his second wife, Hvovi, a member of the influential Hvogva ("possessing good cattle") family. Two other figures belonging to the Hvogva family are mentioned: Frashaoshtra and Jamaspa, the former as Hvovi's father, and the latter as the husband of the third daughter of the prophet, Pouruchista ("very thoughtful"), whose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the Gathas (Yasna 53). Again, according to tradition, Zarathushtra died at the age of seventy-seven. He was assassinated by a karapan, a priest of the old religion, who belonged to the Tuirya tribe and was called Tur i Bradres (his name is known only in the Pahlavi form). The paucity of information on the prophet's life is compensated by a tradi- tion, rich in legendary detail, that arose through the centuries in Zoroastrian communities. The main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of the Denkard, a Pahlavi work dating from the ninth century CE, as well as passages from other Pahlavi texts and a New Persian work from the thirteenth century, the Zarathusht-nama (Book of Zarathushtra), written by Zaratusht-i Bahram-i Pazhdu. Mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about Zarathushtra, which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the perfect man. Zarathushtra's great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the Renaissance until the Enlightenment. During the Classical and Hellenistic periods he was viewed as a wise man, a typical representative of an "alien wisdom," a master of the secrets of heaven and earth, a seer, astrologer, psychologist, and wonder worker. Pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the influence of Zarathushtra on Pythagoras himself, and the Academicians always openly admired the Persian thinker who founded the school of the Magi and advocated a doctrine of dualism. Earliest Christianity viewed Zarathushtra as a precursor of the Christian faith, one who not only prophesied, as had the biblical prophets, the advent of the Messiah but also predicted the supernatural sign of his coming, the star that was to appear in the East and guide the three Magi to the manger in Bethlehem. [See Magi.] This Christian interpretation is derived from the Zoroastrian doctrine of the Saoshyant, the Savior of the Future. [See Saoshyant.] Later, however, religious struggles arose during the Sasanid empire in Persia (third to seventh centuries CE), which linked the spread of Christianity with the Roman empire. Zarathushtra's popularity in the Christian world began to decline. The Iranian prophet, who had been praised often by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by Mani as one of the three great messengers from the past, was now seen, instead, as a leader of imposture and heresy, a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery. But during the Renaiss- ance and the Enlightenment, European cultures reverted to the image of Zara- thushtra that had come down through Classical and Hellenistic antiquity. He was viewed, once again, as a great and wise man, as the author of the _Chaldean Oracles_ and probably inventor of Qabbalah, as a teacher of astrology, as a possible bridge between Christianity and Platonism, and, at times (as in Voltaire), as a symbol of non-Christian wisdom. After Western philology rediscovered Zarathushtra during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Friedrich Nietzsche, in an intentional paradox, gave the name Zarathustra to the hero of his work _Also sprach Zarathustra_ (1883- 1892). Nietzsche saw the Iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the true motive force underlying all things, that is, the eternal struggle between good and evil. [See also Zoroastrianism]	3

I wouldn't make that assumption; I don't think it is a > reasonable assumption. No. It follows from the fact that most Christians' choice of interpretation stems from a mix of beliefs that are influenced by the secular ethics of their culture and that are not fully determined by scripture. Whether or not there is some "right" interpretation matters not; few Christians claim the ability to read the mind of their god. Dave Davis should note that it was Michael who first stated the importance of secular and cultural influence in this thread. I think Michael is right in this, but regardless, it should be noted that this has *not* been a point of contention between Michael and myself. I have argued -- beyond Michael's claims -- that the Christian scriptures are open to so many interpretations -- including a wide divergence within the Christian tradition -- that even their most important themes are vague. Again, it does not matter that there is some "right" interpretation *unless* there is a way to determine what that "right" interpretation is. It is the lack of an objective measure, not the presumed lack of an answer, that puts the force behind the line I argue. > Michael, and I, and others, read 'the Bible' with Christian > glasses.

In my opinion, what makes Michael radical is that he fully acknowledges that Christian scripture and tradition fail to determine the doctrines that so many branches within Christianity hold dear. He is willing to live and practice his religion within this indeterminacy, and he is willing to acknowledge that much of his understanding of things Christian is influenced by ideas that are not purely Christian. Those Christians I have called conservative must also interpret, but they do not recognize -- or at least, are unwilling to admit -- the extent and importance of this. > Russell Turpin (in an earlier post) had said that Michael (Michael's > theological positions, actually) didn't tell him much about Christianity; > Dean Simeon responds (this time gently): 'What do you mean?'

A surprising logical ellipsis. I think the conclusion does follow. The purely Christian principles that Michael has are the ones he shares with others in the Christian tradition or that can be derived from Christian scripture. These, necessarily vague, are not enough to drive his political stances. That one should love one's neighbor is a purely Christian principle. That this means showing tolerance for homosexuality is *not*. As to these political stances, they are often at odds with what is commonly held in most of current Christendom, and so I suspect they could be better pressed outside it. (On the other hand, I can well understand the counterpoint, that these political stances become most influential when presented to those who need them most.) -*---- > This is a theological statement worthy of Barth. > Dr Turpin (DD) may wear the black robe of Geneva yet! :-) Having barely survived the effort to finish in computer science, I doubt I will attempt a more difficult field any time soon!

Brian, does all this mean that you have to be well versed in ancient Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic in order to understand the core of Christianity? I hope you are not Catholic, because my Christian upbringing was based on the teachings of Luther, and the one of the core messages was basically that you don't need to know latin in order to learn about salvation.

Sometimes it is good to know your >enemy, and if you want to do serious research you have to understand >both sides, and not solely the one and only right one. Yes, one does. I examined a critique of the Book of Romans by I think, Benjamin Franklin once, a Deist. I found it amazing that Benjamin Franklin missed the whole boat. I also have the writings on Thomas Jefferson sitting on my shelf, and it is amazing how much he missed. I have studied Plato's Theory of Forms and Aristotelian Hylomorphesism. What a pile of junk. Jesus makes Plato and Aristotle look like kindergardeners. Psychology, the id, ego, superego by Freud? Elements of truth, but Jesus explained it far better and gave reasons. Thomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson are mere men. They can screw up the Bible just as well as any man. I do not put these men on a pedestal. And if I remember T.J.'s autobiography correctly, he thought Thomas Paine was the most unread man he ever met. Here's some more circular reasoning to you. Paul says to the Corinthians that "that the gospel will be foolishness to the world, because it is spiritually discerned." And so, people without the spirit of God haven't a clue to what the Bible is saying. From your point of view, that's incredibly circular and convenient. To me, it is mysteriously and supernaturally bizarre. I can see it, but you can't. This is not arrogance on my part. Trust me. It is as bizarre to you as it is to me. But nonetheless, it is a truth, explainable or not. Are any of you color blind to red and green? I am. Remember those dot tests they do at the optomologist's? They put pictures in front of you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots? If your eyes are perfectly normal, you can see letters or numerals embedded in the dots. They are a slightly different color and stand out from the background. But if you are color blind to red and green, you will not see anything but gray-shaded dots. That is how a dot test appears to me. I do not see a pattern at all. A normal seeing person will see the patterns. And to him, I seem like a total anomaly. To him, I appear as if I am missing the universe or something. It is hard for him to understand why I can't see anything that to him is as plain as day. That it what it is like with the Bible, the Word of God, to the believer. The believer can see the meaning in the words. I can see how the patterns fit together. There is such depth. Such consistency. But then, on the other hand, I notice the non-believer. He doesn't see it. He thinks I am weird because he thinks I am seeing things. I look at him, and say, "No, you are weird. You do not see." Then it is time for a sanity check. I go to another Christian and say, "Do you see this." And they go, "Yes. It is an "X"". And I say, "Thank God, I see the "X" too." It is truly the strangest thing. It adds a little extra dimension to the phrase, "He will make the blind see, and the deaf hear." I am glad that Jesus has enabled me to see. I wish every non-believer could see what they are missing.	3

We do them regardless. Kent Sandvik responds: > Hmm, it seems that this is the core of Christianity then, you > have to feel guilty . . . I think I see where you are coming from Kent. Jesus doesn't view guilt like our modern venacular colors it. "Feelings" have nothing to do with guilt. Feelings arise from the state of being guilty. Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive. Feelings are a reaction from guilt. Jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the reaction. Let me give you an example: Have you ever made a mistake? Have you ever lied to someone? Even a little white lie? Have you ever claimed to know something that you really didn't know? Have you ever hated someone? Have you ever been selfish? Are you guilty of any one of these? The answer is of course, YES. You are guilty. Period. That is it what Jesus is getting at. No big surprise. Feelings do not even enter the picture. Consider Jesus's use of the word "guilt" as how a court uses it. Jesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being imperfect. The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners. We all do bad things. Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our guilt that we are all sinners. It is it in our nature to do bad things. We are sinners, therefore we do bad things. Being a sinner is fact. It is not a pleasant fact. But it is just a fact. We are not perfect. Calling us sinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a human being. Guilty as charged. > and then there's this single personality that will save you from this > universal guilt feeling. You can handle your guilt in one of two ways: Acknowledge you made a mistake, learn from it, and try to not do it again--in the meantime, not punishing yourself for it: which is the way Jesus wants you to handle or it. This is the healthy way. Or two, the destructive way: put yourself down, slap yourself and feel like crap, never forgive yourself, force yourself to say a thousand Hail Marys . . . even to suicide. This the way Jesus does NOT want us to deal with it. All people fall into this category to some extent in their lives. Jesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt feeling. Jesus is in the business of showing us how much he loves us despite our guilt. Jesus knows we are guilty. That isn't new to him. It is no big deal to him. He just wants you to realize that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him. That is what he wants you to know. Why, because he wants to have your company. You are immensely valuable to him. Jesus wants a relationship with you, however, in our present sinful nature, we are incapable of having this relationship. God is perfect. We are not. You cannot fit a square peg into a round hole. However, God has provided a way for us to change our nature so that we can have a relationship with him. God has provided Jesus, so that whosoever just believes in Jesus, will have their nature changed. The Holy Spirit will move it. And now divine nature is now within lives our very being--and us and God communicate with each through his unifying Holy Spirit. The benefits of this are endless. For with the divine nature living within us, we can now see our imperfections better. We can now head them off at the pass. With the power of the Holy Spirit living in us, we now have his power to help us overcome our shortcomings. Because the divine nature lives within us, we can now understand profound Bible passages that never before we could understand. Because the divine nature now lives within us, we now have authority over demonic forces. And lastly, because the divine nature now lives within us, we have eternal life--for the Holy Spirit is eternal. The relationship with Jesus is of the utmost importance. Because it is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to heavenly kingdom, it is your relationship to the living God. Remember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when he separated the "goats from the sheep". Many people in the last day will ask him, "Didn't I prophesy in your name and do miracles, and do good things in your name?" And what did Jesus say? "Depart from me, for I never *knew* you." That is the cornerstone of Christianity, Kent. Jesus must know you as his friend. It is your relationship to Jesus. If he is your friend and you are his, you will be counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven. > Brian, I will tell you a secret, I don't feel guilty at all, > I do mistakes, and I regret them, however I've never had this > huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder. Good. It shows that you have a strong self-image--that you love yourself. That is the second greatest commandment Jesus taught. If only more people could do as you do. As I said before, in the common english venacular, "feeling guilty" has a different meaning than the state of guilt. > This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain > personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain > religious doctrines.

"Come to me, take my yoke upon your shoulders, for my burden is light." A yoke is used to direct oxen to do work. Once you have a relationship with Jesus, you and him share the yoke and the burdens of life. Having God at your side is of great advantage.	3

First and foremost, I honestly do not believe that Jesus was anything more than a man who lived and died two thousand years ago. I know your Bible provides wonderful stories of the things he said and did, but I simply do not believe that he still exists as an entity that has any bearing on this universe or the lives in it, and I similarly do not believe that the god that you worship exists or has ever existed. Period. I view religion in general and Christianity in specific as a 'cultural virus' that has been passed down from generation to generation because people are often too afraid to think for themselves and claim responsibility for their own fate, so they brainwash themselves and their children into believing the popular myths, and it goes on from there. And eventually Christianity becomes a given -- if so many other people believe in it, it must be right, no? I don't believe in any "life after death". I believe that when I die, I die, so therefore it's up to me to try to bring meaning and purpose to my life in the meantime. I don't believe that it's a good thing to humble myself and view pride as a sin -- pride, in moderation, is a constructive thing. I see nothing at all wrong with homosexuality and nothing inferior about women, and my priests lost a lot of my trust when they patronizingly tried to explain the 'faults' of these opinions to me. I don't believe in 'loving everyone', especially people I've never met; while I try to show respect to everyone, my love and admiration is something not easily earned, and I do not feel guilty about denying my respect and consideration to someone who has abused it. If you want me to take your religion the least bit seriously, stop trying to show me how the Bible "makes sense".

Well, suppose a probe emitting radiation at a constant frequency was sent towards a black hole. As it got closer to the event horizon, the red shift would keep increasing. The period would get longer and longer, but it would never stop. An observer would not observe the probe actually reaching the event horizon.

We have reached the point in our society when there are certain crimes that are so heinous that to merely be accused with them one is automaticly considered guilty and deemed not to have any natural rights much less civil rights. Among these are drug abuse, sexual perversion, and political incorrectness. Today Billary accused Koresh of having SEX with infants. He had been accused of a number of differing crimes (inconsistantly) over the last two months, but this is the first time I have heard that one. I had heard child abuse but this is somewhat stronger. It is fairly obvious that Koresh was hiding behind the children; and ironicly considering his apocalyptic dread, believed enough in the American People's inherent goodness to believe he was protected. It is truly amazing that all these people who 60 days ago had never heard of the Branch Davidian now believe that he was suicidal, crazy, a child abuser and a immenant danger to others based solely on what the Government spokespersons had said. Remember that these people have an awful lot to loose if it is found that they have screwed up. But they don't have as much to lose as David Koresh and his followers lost. For in our society as it stands murder is not one of the heinous crimes. --------------------------------------------------------------------- cutter@gloster.via.mind.org (chris) All jobs are easy to the person who doesn't have to do them.

Whether or not it was appropriate to use this strategy on the BD is not my point, since I don't think any of us have enough information to make a clear judgement on this issue. I merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day. Furthermore, we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects. Do you suggest that the police always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have been allowed to inspect the officers's badges? Just what should the police do when apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects? How far can they reasonably go to identiy themselves? What do you suggest they can do which can't be faked by the "competition"? Even if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops, that's not an excuse to murder police.

If a scientist creates a unique living creature #(which has happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the #right to expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...? Dear Joakim, let me begin by saying that these are excellent questions, but that by asking, you will find as many different explanations as there are respondents. As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that all of us (you, me, etc.) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father (Hebrews 12:9) in the pre-mortal existance. In order to continue our eternal progression, an earthly probationary time was required. (To live by faith, not by sight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all things to become worthy of a higher order of existance.) We believe that all of God's spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of this earthly sojourn. One-third chose for Lucifer's plan, most followed the Firstborn (the pre-mortal Jesus Christ). Lucifer's aspirations ("I will exalt my throne above the stars of God . . ." Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.) resulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and those who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (who became Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven ("And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth . . ." Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits). To get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject to God and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices), we made that choice individually. (God speaking to Job: "Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" Job 38:4-7). We lost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the "Veil of Forgetful- ness," somewhere in Psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight. You may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on the Bible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular aspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of God. #Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so #righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep, #unable to do otherwise that follow the rest? # #Hmmmmmmmmmmmm. (All Christians, by definition, ARE a flock of sheep, following the Shepherd as they understand Him ;-) --But in any event, not all Christians believe in the same theology, such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in. (They will cry "heresy" and other accusations of "perverting" the doctrines of the Bible, while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations, as found in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals...) As for me, I have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario as explained above, is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine, some Dead Sea Scroll books, the pseudographion, other (Jewish) sources, and last but not least, modern-day revelation on the subject. #I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, I mean it. # # How should one deal with a man who is convinced that # he is acting according to God's will, and who there- # Jokke fore believes that he is doing you a favour by # stabbing you in the back? # # -Voltaire Casper C.

Convenient? It seems very appropriate that this is cross-posted to alt.conspiracy. Assuming the most favorable interpretation of your '1000 degree' measurement (that the temperature is in Centigrade, rather than the more common -in the US- Fahrenheit), you are still laboring under at least 2 misconceptions: 1. You seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 C. Actually, the melting point of most iron alloys (and steels are iron alloys) is in the neighborhood of 1400 C. Even if the gun were found in area which achieved the 1000 C temperature, the steel parts of the gun would not be deformed, and it would still be trivial to identify the nature of the weapon. 2. A fire is not an isothermal process. There are 'hot' spots and 'cold' spots, though 'cold' is purely a relative term. So the weapon was not necessarily situated in a hot spot, as you seem to imply. And, even if it was, so what? It would not have melted anyway. darin wilkins@scubed.com ________________________________ | | | I will be President for food | |______________________________|	3

My reason for asking for such evidence is that last night on Larry King Live a so-called "cult-expert" was interviewed from Australia who claimed that it was his evidence which led to the original raid. This admission, if true, raises the nasty possibility that the Government acted in good faith, which I believe they did, on faulty evidence. It also raises the possibility that other self proclaimed cult experts were advising them and giving ver poor advice. A few years ago Anson Shupe and David Bromley published STRANGE GODS: THE GREAT AMERICAN CULT SCARE (Beacon, Boston, 1981 - and THE NEW VIGILANTES: ANTI-CULTISTS AND NEW RELIGIONS -Sage, Beverly Hills, 1980.

Cops are not cops _until_ they identify themselves as police officers. Most drug dealers and professional criminals are aware of the likelihood of arrest but they also know how the system works. If they are arrested they call their lawyer, post bail and hope for a plea bargain. If they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will be charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid. Drug dealers have guns for protection from their customers and other criminals, not to shoot cops. Cops are shot on no-knock drug raids because the criminals aren't aware that they are cops. No-knock raids on homes occupied by non-criminals are more likely to end in disaster. Mom and Pop citizen _KNOW_ that they have not committed any crime, they KNOW that anyone breaking into their house cannot be a cop because they have done nothing wrong. If they have the means to defend themselves they may because they KNOW that the housebreakers are criminals not cops. Cops and homeowners may die. The first reports from Waco stated that the ATF had a warrant to search for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegal weapons were found. In this case the no-knock warrant was not called for. It is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet. The ATF could have surrounded the compound. A marked police car could have driven up to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and served the warrant usual way. It this had happened and and Koresh refused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most of the t.p.g folks would have kept quiet. -- Rod Anderson N0NZO | "I do not think the United States government Boulder, CO | is responsible for the fact that a bunch of rcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu | fanatics decided to kill themselves" satellite N0NZO on ao-16 | Slick Willie the Compassionate	3

Your paragraph above seems to indicate there might be. The OED gives the etymology of "sibyl" as coming from the ancient Greek sigma iota beta upsilon lambda lambda alpha ( S i b ih l l a ) which is claimed to come from the Doric sigma iota omicron beta upsilon lambda lambda alpha ( s i o b ih l l a ) which (if I read it properly) in turn came from the Attican (Athenian) theta epsilon omicron beta omicron upsilon lambda eta ( th eh o b o ih l ae ) I don't know much about Attis, but it wouldn't surprise me to learn that this God was tied to the Athenian capital Alpha tau tau iota kappa upsilon sigma (a t t i k u s) The OED does not list any etymology for "Cybele" since that is a propper noun, but I suggest that the Greek spelling of that word would be much closer to the anticedants of Sibyl than the two words are now. Perhaps "Cybele" is a French or Latin spelling?	3

Bit of a coincidence, that. Never lived out in the country I see. 4 years ago I had a place where I had to carry in propane every month, hook the bottle up to copper line, to supply both the stove, and a type of water- heater called a flash-heater. A flash heater has a pilot lamp. Here's the point. If the Davidians had their propane tanks hooked up to copper (or some such) lines, run through the ceiling spaces -- when the FBI started wrecking the place, they could easily have ruptured the lines.

The goal of the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run is simple: to bring this spirit forward in a concrete way, to transform it into a reality in their own lives. Every other year, thousands of men, women and children from more than 70 nations - passing a flaming Peace Torch from hand to hand - join together in a relay run that virtually circles the globe. Transcending political and cultural boundaries, they go from nation to nation - across mountains, jungles and deserts - carrying the message of brotherhood to all humankind. Each person who holds or runs with the Peace Torch lights a path for those who follow. Each time the Peace Torch changes hands, the flame of oneness burns a little brighter - until one day it will shine in the hearts and minds of every individual on earth. ---- Making History ---- The three Peace Runs since 1987 have achieved some historic break- throughs: in the Middle East, a landmark run crossed the Egyptian- Israeli border; in Europe, a precedent-setting run linked Eastern and Western Europe with Russia; in the United States, Mexico and Canada, entire cities were dedicated to the cause of world peace; and in Poland, the Peace Torch was blessed by Pope John Paul II. ---- Speaking as One: World ---- ---- Leaders, Celebrities - and You ---- The Peace Run has won the support of leaders the world over - Presidents, Prime Ministers, religious leaders, sports figures and entertainment personalities. Its message has spread to a half billion people though newspaper reports, magazine articles and radio and TV broadcasts, including specials on PBS, MTV and NBC's Today Show. > "I am happy to support your Peace Run for justice, peace and reconciliation. The world must know that God wants us to live amicably as brothers and sisters, members of one family, the human family, God's family." - Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Nobel Peace Prize Winner ---- How It All Works ---- Peace Run 1993 started with a five-borrough relay in New York City on Saturday April 17, converging at various points to lead up to the opening ceremony outside the United Nations Dag Hammarskjold Building. There, runners from around the world were gathered for the fourth lighting of the Peace Torch. From there, Peace Torches are now being transported to over seventy countries for a series of concurrent international or cross-country relay runs including the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, Russia and Eastern and Western Europe. Smaller runs will take place in the Philippines, Mexico, Israel, South America, Egypt and elsewhere in Africa. Distance to be covered: 31,000 miles. >"The Peace Run wil do much to inspire the hearts and stimulate the minds of those who support, participate in, witness, or hear about the event." - Carl Lewis, Six-Time Olympic Gold Medalist ---- Who's Behind It ---- The Peace Run is sponsored by the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team, an international running organization that believes sports can be a powerful instrument for promoting world peace. Each year the Team puts on hundreds of athletic events, including several world-class ultramarathons, marathons and triathlons, in dozens of countries. The Peace Run itself is inspired by the global peace ambassador Sri Chinmoy, who has written and lectured extensively on peace, offered hundreds of free peace concerts and met with countless world figures to advance the cause of international harmony. The Run is managed by Peace Runs International, a non-profit organization based in the United States. ---- Take a Step For Peace ---- The Peace Runs in 1987, 1989 and 1991 attracted nearly half a million participants. We're expecting even more people to join Peace Run '93. You can also join the Run - carrying the Peace Torch a few steps, a few blocks or a few miles. Or you can come out and cheer the runners as they carry the Torch through your community. You can also join local celebrities and government officials in one of the thousands of welcoming ceremonies scheduled along the 70-nation route. Your inner support is important too. If you're a runner, each time you go out, you can dedicate your run to the cause of world peace. ---- The Next Step is Yours ---- ---- Make It One For Peace ---- For information contact: Peace Runs International 161-44 Normal Road Jamaica, NY 11432 USA tel. 718/291-6637 Fax: 718/291-6978 Peace Run Canada 2456 Agricola Street Halifax, Nova Scotia B3K 4C2 tel. 902/425-1174 Fax: 902/420-0773 or for the phone number or address of a Peace Run office in your town or country, reply to this message by e-mail.	3

104	From: mcelwre@cnsvax.uwec.edu Subject: LARSONIAN Astronomy, Physics, CREATION Organization: University of Wisconsin Eau Claire Lines: 556 The following partial summary of a Theory of the Universe includes a little-known description of the CREATION of our Solar System: LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics Orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists CLAIM to be looking for a "Unified Field Theory" in which all of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single set of laws or equations. But they have been systematically IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he calls the "Reciprocal System", is built on two fundamental postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of space and time: (1) "The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME." (2) "The physical universe conforms to the relations of ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN." From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational- rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light (which Larson called "UNIT VELOCITY" and "THE NATURAL DATUM"). At each step in the development, Larson was able to MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY BURSTS). And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter- atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of matter. All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy complex mathematics, in his books. BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson The following is a complete list of the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe. Some of the early books are out of print now, but still available through inter-library loan. "The Structure of the Physical Universe" (1959) "The Case AGAINST the Nuclear Atom" (1963) "Beyond Newton" (1964) "New Light on Space and Time" (1965) "Quasars and Pulsars" (1971) "NOTHING BUT MOTION" (1979) [A $9.50 SUBSTITUTE for the $8.3 BILLION "Super Collider".] [The last four chapters EXPLAIN chemical bonding.] "The Neglected Facts of Science" (1982) "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" (1984) [FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL astrophysical mysteries.] "BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER" (1988) All but the last of these books were published by North Pacific Publishers, P.O. Box 13255, Portland, OR 97213, and should be available via inter-library loan if your local university or public library doesn't have each of them. Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS), 1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah 84106. This is the organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory. They have other related publications, including the quarterly journal "RECIPROCITY". Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer (Chemical or Electrical). He was about 91 years old when he died in May 1989. He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State University. He developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE chemical properties based only on the elements used. Larson's lack of a fancy "PH.D." degree might be one reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is NOT A VALID REASON. Sometimes it takes a relative outsider to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES. At the same time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally test his Theory. And it was NOT necessary for him to do so. He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER researchers' experimental and observational data. And in many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX physicists and astronomers have! They CLAIM to be looking for a "unified field theory" that works, but have been IGNORING one for over 30 years now! "Modern physics" does NOT explain the physical universe so well. Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who agree. And remember that "epicycles", "crystal spheres", "geocentricity", "flat earth theory", etc., ALSO once SEEMED to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or still is) President of Larson's organization, "THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE", and Editor of their quarterly Journal "RECIPROCITY". He moved to Minneapolis after retiring. "Super Collider" BOONDOGGLE! I am AGAINST contruction of the "Superconducting Super Collider", in Texas or anywhere else. It would be a GROSS WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of "scientific" value. Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY particles ("mesons", "hyperons", ALLEGED "quarks", etc.) which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible with their environment. A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 BILLION cost?!! Don't we have much more important uses for this WASTED money?! Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some kind of "fire ants" eating the insulation off underground cables. How much POISONING of the ground and ground water with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of the "Supercollider"?! Naming the "Super Collider" after Ronald Reagon, as proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD! If it is built, it should be named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. LARSONIAN Anti-Matter In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of opposite charges of the same types of particles. It has more to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the photons of which they are made, in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, which Larson calls "Unit Velocity" and the "Natural Datum". In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of MATTER, NOT anti-matter. When a positron and electron meet, the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each other. In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our MATERIAL half. LARSONIAN Relativity The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the rate of 574 seconds of arc per century. 531 seconds of this advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, etc.). The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to help "prove" Einstein's "General Theory of Relativity". But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results CLOSER to the 43 seconds than "General Relativity" can, by INSTEAD using "SPECIAL Relativity". In one or more of his books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. Larson TOTALLY REJECTED "General Relativity" as another MATHEMATICAL FANTASY. He also REJECTED most of "Special Relativity", including the parts about "mass increases" near the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than 1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead of only one. But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured from our material half of the physical universe. The one dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time. At low relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. [Larson often used the term "COORDINATE TIME" when writing about this.] In regard to "mass increases", it has been PROVEN in atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near the speed of light. But the formula for acceleration is ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m). Orthodox physicists are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE. In Larson's Theory, mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero. FORCE is actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS. The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of the so-called "Big Bang" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL FANTASY). THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon 97213), 456 pages, indexed, hardcover. It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of the "3-degree" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma- ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with OPEN MINDS! The following is an example of his Theory's success: In his first book in 1959, "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them. They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's comprehensive Theory. And when QUASARS were discovered, he had an immediate related explanation for them also. GAMMA-RAY BURSTS Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS. They were originally thought to originate from "neutron stars" in the disc of our galaxy. But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of directional coincidence). Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson. According to page 386 of his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", published in 1984, the gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the "Cosmic Sector". Because of the relationship between the anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at random. (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do not correspond with known objects, and come from all directions uniformly.) I wonder how close to us in space a source location would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most life on Earth! There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to stop it! Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun are binary or double. But orthodox astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson. I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is detailed in Chapter 7 of his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" and in some of his other books. First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate energy by "fusion". A small fraction comes from slow gravitational collapse. The rest results from the COMPLETE ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON). Each element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT. The heavier the element is, the lower is this limit. A star's internal temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and lighter elements. When the internal temperature of the star reaches the destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION! This is because there is SO MUCH iron present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some of his books [better than I can]. When the star explodes, the lighter material on the outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less than the speed of light. The heavier material in the center portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to the speed of light, because of the high temperature. The explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall back gravitationally. The material that had been blown outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star. The material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a WHITE DWARF star. BOTH stars then start moving back toward the "MAIN SEQUENCE" from opposite directions on the H-R Diagram. The chances of the two masses falling back into the exact same location in space, making a single lone star again, are near zero. They will instead form a BINARY system, orbiting each other. According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown outward) in time. This ELIMINATES the need to resort to MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about "degenerate matter", "neutron stars", "black holes", etc.. LARSONIAN Solar System Formation If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL "mini" white dwarf stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected by its heat, etc.). These will become PLANETS! In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all this information, and other principles of his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive his own version of Bode's Law. "Black Hole" FANTASY! I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO "black holes" merging together into a SINGLE "black hole", and concluded that the new "black hole" would have MORE MASS than the sum of the two original "black holes". Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of "black holes", etc.! After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, especially his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", it is clear to me that "black holes" are NOTHING more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES! The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the "black hole" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want to "prove" their theory. By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is being given to physicist Stephen Hawking. The physicists and astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical problem somehow makes him "wiser". It does NOT! I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive. Widespread publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of Unified Science). ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. I found a possible clue about why they might work on pages 112-113 of the book "BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER", by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe. I quote one paragraph: "As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance. The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment. It was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book "NOTHING BUT MOTION"] that there are physical processes in operation which produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are limited. It follows that there is always a large excess of free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the universe, most of which are uncharged. In this uncharged state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, and the relation of space to space is not motion. In open space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system, in the manner of a photon. In the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system. All material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation. Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, whereby electrons are returned to the environment. The electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level." Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a particular frequency (above the "unit" frequency) spinning around one axis at a particular rate (below the "unit" rate). ("Unit velocity" is the speed of light, and there are vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, according to Larson's Theory.) [I might have the "above" and "below" labels mixed up.] Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass- LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of light! If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency (above the "unit" frequency) superimposed on the rotation of the particle.) The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is generated in clouds. SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in his first book "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE". It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call "science" (or "physics", or "astronomy", etc.), as well as the "scientific" literature and the "education" systems, to TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have. Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, in the U.S. and elsewhere. And at least the basic principles of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

I hereby state that I am not claiming or denying membership in any Order, fraternity etc. with or without the word "Rosicrucian" in the name of the organization. I only claim having done some "homework" :-) This is intended as a friendly article and if at times it seems different, it's my lack of writing skills showing, nothing else. Heck, English may be my second language! (And then again maybe not by now :-) I proceed: > >I had an ehum, interesting experience with the Rosicrucians, or at >least Rosicrucians of some sort last Sunday. > Let's start with the name "Rosicrucian". I took me a long time to come to the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a "rosicrucian" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met some 'rosicrucians' you mean "members of a group that calls themselves rosicrucian". At least that is what your observation suggests :-) I'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium Rosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this newsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in San Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I looked). Of course, "most members" does not *necessarily* mean "best". Anyway, the Lectorium Rosicrucianum claims they descend (at least in part) from what was the "Gold-und-Rosenkreuz" (Golden and Rosy Cross), from the 18th century. There were two "Golden and Rosy Cross", the first (chronologically) more alchemical, the second with Masonic tinges, but their history is the subject of a complete chapter :-). "You'll have to trust me" when I tell you that if that lecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you would have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a positive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO. >The first guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and >that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars >(English?) from the thirteenth century. > Again, instead of R:s, it should be "Lectorium Rosicrucianum" :-). It is curious to know that 3 other RC 'orders' (in the USA) claim to be *non- sectarian*. The Cathars were a 'heretic' christian sect that directly challenged the 'authority' of the medieval catholic church. They flourished during the 12th century, century which saw the religious zeal expressed in the crusades and also the growing disillusion with the catholic church and the worldly ways of its clerics. It was largely in response to the church's unseemly pomp and splendor that Catharism took root, first in northern Italy, then throughout the south of France. >What made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all >contained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity, >then that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently, >but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss.

If what was being discussed could be established or disproven by experiment and observation, then I would agree with you, Chris. The burden of proof would belong to Bill. But the source document for Christianity, the Bible, simply assumes God exists and makes it clear (to us Calvinists, anyway :-)) that when a person is in fellowship with God, it is because God has taken the initiative in revealing Himself to that person. So from a Christian point of view, the burden of proof belongs to God. Bill is being consistent with what the Bible teaches in relating his own experience with God, but it would be an error on his part to assume that there is a direct, causal relationship between his testimony and someone else becoming convinced that God exists and that he needs to be reconciled to God. > >If you are merely giving testimony to your beliefs, then you are an egotist.

This brings up another something I have never understood. I asked this once before and got a few interesting responses, but somehow didn't seem satisfied. Why would the NT NOT be considered a good source. This might be a literary/historical question, but when I studied history I always looked for firsthand original sources to write my papers. If the topic was on Mr. X, I looked to see if Mr. X wrote anything about it. If the topic was on a group, look for the group, etc. If the topic is on Mr. X, and Mr. X did not write anything about it, (barring the theistic response about the Bible being divinely inspired which I can't adequately argue), wouldn't we look for people who ate, worked, walked, talked, etc. with him? If someone was at an event wouldn't they be a better "reporter" than someone who heard about it second hand? I guess isn't firsthand better than second hand.

There is an amount of give and take as in any relationship. Parents are supposed to be kind and loving but does that mean that children can do whatever they want? NOT! Part of being a parent means administering punishment when the child is at fault. Part of being a parent means giving instruction. God tests us through the trial of life such that we may grow stronger. He teaches what is right and what is wrong. The consequences of our actions are made clear to us, be it Heaven or be it Hell. If God did not follow through with what He has warned us about, He would not be a very good parent. In parenting, if a parent issues a warning but does not follow through with it, the children will not take that parent's words very seriously. God does the same by telling us who have ears to hear what to do and what not to do. By life's trials, we see the folly of doing our own will rather than His. He warns us about the consequences of rejecting Him when it comes time for Judgement. Do we follow Him? I will. Peace be with you, Malcolm Lee :) |> Just curious. |> |> --Dave Wood	3

These *facts* exist with or without a theory. The *theory* tries and explains the *facts* and how they relate to the rest of the physical universe in a manner that is both coherent and useful, that it can be used to make predictions. The *facts* of gravity, evolution, electromagnetic radiation, relativity, atoms will exist and behave in the way in which they behave regardless of whether we have a theory to try and explain how they interact... or even why. A theory never really becomes a fact... but a theory can predict the existence of a previously unknown fact, and if we find this fact as the theory predicted we say the *theory* is *supported* by the *facts*. A theory is a mental construct, a speculation, a model. If it is a good model, it may be useful. In science a theory is something that is supported by the evidence, considerable evidence, sometimes *all* of the evidence. A *hypothesis* is a new fledgling theory because there is not yet enough evidence to support it. When a new hypothesis is proposed to replace an existing theory, it must explain *all* of the facts that the current theory explains and at least some of the facts that the current theory could not and/or predict new facts.

Looking at your discussion I would say that you both operate from your own reference frame. There's no inside and no outside, there are just two polarized views. As for statements inside the Bible, things are still not that clear, we don't have any indications for instance why Jobs was placed in the Old Testament, one of the few books that actually talks about Satan. Jobs is very much out of line with the rest of the OT books, and there's a chance that someone added this book later into the group of OT scriptures. > Now in your sense, Kent, of sensing reality--that is a different > matter.

This operates the other way around as well. You have to understand the mind of an atheist, agnostic, or as in my case, a radical relativist. If you don't understand the underlying concepts, it is pretty hard to continue with a dialogue. I'm not a perfect Christian, however about 20+ years of Christian teaching should have provided me with a pretty good picture of the Christian mind frame. Cheers, Kent --- sandvik@newton.apple.com.

(1) You have no evidence that David Koresh or his followers were "packing" that heavy weaponry with any intent to use for other that recreational and self-defense purposes. (2) Your statement that "the public also has rights" is correct only is parsed as "the individuals who comprise the public also have rights." There is no separate rights-bearing entity known as "the public". (3) Since the "rights of the public" of which you spoke are in fact only rights of individuals, the statement that the rights of the public should be placed above the rights of the individual has no meaning. (4) You have artificially created an illusionary conflict of individuals' rights when you speak of "my right to rape your daughter." No person has the right to rape another person, therefore there is no conflict. (5) How do you define "society?" Do you hold that this "society" is a rights-bearing entity which is separate from any individual people? How do you define a "threat to society?"

It would be contradictory for Koresh to go for "mass suicide" - remember that Koresh's death was the opening of the sixth seal - the signal that Armageddon had begun. His army (the people in the compound) would then fight the powers of evil and win, ending in the Rapture. The fire wiped out his army.

Lines: 169 Brian Ceccarelli presents us with the fallacy of False Dichotomy in stating that we must accept every thing in the books attributed to Peter, or we must discount every other book of antiquity: >>(1) Peter died two millenia ago. The original letters he wrote have >>long since decayed into dust. If he were alive today and I could > > Do you question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III, > Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes? Their documents > have decayed to dust too. Brian, why another excuse? Mr Ceccarelli, you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything written in every "historical" document. Somehow I doubt do that yourself that. Thus since I doubt you accept everything written in every historical document, I would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith in the words of the books attributed to Peter. I shall now give an example of a document from antiquity, which I am sure you reject; it dates from the time of Ramses II (This was first presented here by Matthew Wiener). These inscriptions were carved soon after a battle, and were carved with the Pharoah's specific approval so we have true originals, rather than mere copies. This account records the the battle of Kadesh (circa 1285 BC), which occurred on the river Orontes, (about 100 miles south of Aleppo). The Egyptians won this battle with the Hittites, and Ramses had his victory inscribed all over the place. A few of of these inscriptions have survived in near perfect form. It is a record of how the Pharoah pretty much single-handedly defeated the Hittites, after being separated from his troops. Note that the Egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person. The following is from Miriam Lichtheim`s _Ancient Egyptian Literature_ volume II. My majesty caused the forces of the foes from Hitti to fall on their faces, one upon the other, as crocodiles fall, into the water of the Orontes. I was after them like a griffin; I attacked all the countries, I alone. For my infantry and my chariotry had deserted me; not one of them stood looking back. As I live, as Ra loves me, as my father Atum favors me, everything that my majesty has told I did it in truth, in the presence of my infantry and my chariotry. (Note: This paragraph records not only Ramses "divine word," but also that there were thousands of witnesses to the event. Now from the heart of battle.) Then his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces of the Foe from Hitti, being alone by himself, none other with him. His majesty proceeded to look about him and found 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out ... No officer was with me, no charioteer, No soldier of the army, no shield-bearer; My infantry, my chariotry yielded before them, Not one of them stood firm to fight with them. His majesty spoke: "What is this, father Amun? Is it right for a father to ignore his son? Are my deeds a matter for you to ignore? Do I not walk and stand at your word? I have not neglected an order you gave. Too great is he, the great lord of Egypt, To allow aliens to step on his path! What are these Asiatics to you, O Amun, The wretches ignorant of god? Have I not made for you many great monuments, ... I call to you, my father Amun, I am among a host of strangers; All countries are arrayed against me, I am alone, there's none with me! ... The labors of many people are nothing, Amun is more helpful than they; I came here by the command of your mouth, O Amun, I have not transgressed your command!" Now though I prayed in a distant land, My voice resounded in Southern Thebes. I found Amun came when I called to him, He gave me his hand and I rejoiced. He called from behind as if near by: "Forward, I am with you, I your father, my hand is with you, I prevail over a hundred thousand men, I am lord of victory, lover of valor!" I found my heart stout, my breast in joy, All I did succeeded, I was like Mont. ... I slaughtered among them at my will, Not one looked behind him, Not one turned around, Whoever fell down did not rise. ... One called out to the other saying: "No man is he who is among us, It is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person; Not deeds of man are these his doings, They are of one who is unique, Who fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots, Come quick, flee before him, To seek life and breathe air; For he who attempts to get close to him, His hands, all his limbs grow limp. One cannot hold either bow or spears, When one sees him come racing along!" My majesty hunted them like a griffin, I slaughtered among them unceasingly. So you see Brian, we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous battle between the Ramses and the Hittites. Do you reject them as being *completely* true? I suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your own words: "question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III, Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?" Do you also thereby question all their documents? That`s the problem with your "all or nothing" approach. Many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy with their facts. So for you to say that we must either accept all of Peter (and the rest of the New Testament) or accept no records of antiquity at all, forces you thereby, to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find completely credible. As to your other argument that so many people have testified to Jesus, that he must be true: > Are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? > Are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from > shepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer > programmers, fiction? With a scoff of your keyboard, with near > complete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that > that is all complete hooey? Would that not be the most audacious > display of arrogance? Do you actually think you know better than > King Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincoln? I have three points. First, this is "argumentum ad populum" (ie: appeal to popular opinion); you cannot vote on truth. For instance, do the millions of Hindu's past and present who testify to the reality of Brahma, constitute actual evidence for the existence of Brahma? How would you answer your own question in regards to the testimony of Hindus: "With a scoff of your keyboard, with near complete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that that is all complete hooey?" If you do so "scoff," then how do you objectively justify your own special pleading? Second, it is not at all clear that King Solomon or King David testified to Jesus. You can claim it to be clear, but that does not make it true. Third, it is quite arguable that Abraham Lincoln was not Christian, and that he had both a public and a private view of Christianity. In fact there was much discussion about it in his day (yes, he was publically accused of being a deist. Oh my). I am presently collecting a FAQ for Lincoln as I've previously done for Tyre, Jefferson and etc. Later, Dave Butler "My earlier views of the unsoundness of the Christian scheme of salvation and the human origin of the scriptures, have become clearer and stronger with advancing years and I see no reason for thinking I shall ever change them."

[deletia: Joe Gaut indicates his interest in the BD disaster is from a civil liberties issue, not an attempt to justify Koresh's beliefs and/or practices.] I agree with Joe about this: if some group wants to believe in whatever god or Invisible Pink Unicorns and go off and live together and have group sex, or no sex, or sex only for the leaders (but NOT with children), then, as much as I might believe them to be misguided, I think they should have the legal right. And I hope the investigation will start by determining whether the feds had any *legitimate* reason for going after Koresh in the first place (before moving on to consider the wisdom of various tactics used). [Joe goes on to dispute the child-abuse allegations. I'll (provisionally) accept this, unless someone has evidence to support the allegations?] Actually I wasn't thinking about the (alleged) child abuse, but about the reports that he had sex with, and fathered children by, several women in the cult. I agree this is not a legal matter - consenting adults and all that - but Stephen Tice seems to be defending Koresh's beliefs and practices from specifically *Christian* perspective, not a civil liberties perspective.

Then we all live happily ever after. :-) Seriously, if we all agreed on the circumstances we're in, I suspect we'd all agree on the best course of action. Unfortunately, I have no confidence that such a situation will ever arise. Some of us think there's a big God in the sky, some don't. Some think they've been chosen by God, others disagree. Some think they are infallible, others think otherwise. Until those disagreements over circumstances can be ironed out, there's little hope of everyone agreeing. > Or say, for all practical intents and purposes, there is no frame > of reference in which thus and such is good, isn't that approximately > objective, in the same way that we usually expect a speeding bullet to > outrun a snail? Yes. I think that, for example, only a vanishingly small number of people would hold that there's a frame of reference in which gassing six million Jews is good.

It comes from 'orthos' (straight, true, right) and from 'doxa' (opinion, doctrine, teaching). I use orthodox to refer to 'right teaching.' Right teaching is derived from letting God speak to us through the Bible. This can be from reading simple truths in the Scriptures and by using the Bible to interpret the Bible. ra> Who is that "holds that" Luke meant what you said he meant? I think that it is apparent from reading the Scriptures that are pertinent. Luke 23:43 records Christ's promise to the repentant thief who hung on an adjacent cross: "Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in paradise." But was it not until later that Christ rose from the dead and ascended to heaven? If Christ Himself was not in heaven until Sunday, how could the repentant thief have been there with Him? The answer lies in the location of "paradise" when Jesus died. Apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until Easter Day. Jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and Lazarus as "Abraham's Bosom," to which the godly beggar Lazarus was carried by the angels after his decease (Luke 16:19-31). Thus "Abraham's Bosom" referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed waited till the day of Christ's Resurrection. It was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of hades (Hebrew: Sheol), reserved for believers who had died in the faith but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of God in heaven until the price of redemption had actually been paid on Calvary; or even that none would precede the presence of Jesus back to glory with the Father. Doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of Jesus and the repentant thief repaired after they each died on Friday afternoon. But on Sunday, after the risen Christ had first appeared to Mary Magdalene (John 20:17) and her two companions (Matthew 28:9), presumably He then took up with Him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise (including Abraham, Lazarus, and the repentant thief). We read in Ephesians 4:8 concerning Christ: "Ascending on high, He led captivity captive; He gave gifts unto men." Verse 9 continues: "But what does `He ascended' mean but that He also descended to the lowest parts of the earth?" -i.e., to hades. Verse 10 adds: "He who descended is the same as He who ascended above all the heavens." Presumably He led the whole band of liberated captives from hades (i.e., the whole population of preresurrection paradise) up to the glory of heaven. ra> Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is ra> challenged, your only response seems to be that one needs merely to ra> "look at the Bible" in order to see the truth, but what of those who ra> see Biblical things differently from you?

A myth is more than a single story. The thought structure and world-paradigm in which that story is interpreted is as important a part of the myth as the story itself. Thus, I can think of no story which is meant to be conveyed understandably from one person to another within a single culture which won't rest upon that underlying thought structure, and thus transmit some of that culture's mythical "truths" along with it. randy	3

It's similar to collecting coins, or stamps, or campaign buttons, or coke bottles, or juke boxes, or model trains, or just about anything else that is collected (and just about everything is collected). In all cases, you might consider it something of an aberration; I mean, what purpose does it serve? Not much really; it's just a hobby. The collector yearns for diversity (not much use in having TWO of the same thing, except for trading/selling it), historical significance (this was the thingy used by so-and-so), technical significance (this is the only one that does such-and-such like this; this is the first one to do it this way), rarity, and so on. Some people use their collections, other people do not. As you state, you use your collection. In one sense, this diminishes the value of your collection as the items suffer wear and exposure. In another sense, it can enhance your own enjoyment of your collection. Some people collect firearms that they do not use; other people use some or all of the firearms they collect.

God is God. But all humans are sinners, thus all pre-Jesus humans should have been punished with death. We aren't punished with sin now, of course, because God has changed.

You're missing something here. There are people who convert from non-theism to theism after being brought up in a non-theist household. (I don't have any statistics as to how many though. That would be an interesting thing to know.) I think that religion is a crutch. People are naturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable. People don't want to believe that when they die, they are dead, finished. That there is nothing else after that. And so religion is kind of a nice fantasy. Religion also describes things we don't know about the universe (things science has not yet described) and it also gives people a feeling of security... that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok. That they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions. This has a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these people are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their belief system for what it gains them. This is why I think it's kind of useless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism. They are happy with their fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too (they can't accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept the harsh reality that they are running from). Anyway, I'm getting kind of carried away here. But my point is that theism doesn't have to be ingrained into a child's mindset for that person to grow up as a theist (although this happens far too often). Theism is designed to have its own attractions. > > _/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ * Atheist > _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ * Libertarian > _/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ _/ * Pro-individuality > _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ * Pro-responsibility > _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ _/ _/ Jr. * and all that jazz...

I took me a long time to come to the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a "rosicrucian" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met some 'rosicrucians' you mean "members of a group that calls themselves rosicrucian". At least that is what your observation suggests :-) Response: This makes much sense to me. This is also true of most religions. There is a difference between being a *member* of a group of people who call themselves 'Hindus' or 'Christians' or 'Pagans' and actually *BEING* any of these. The social groups tend to make very important requirements about not belonging to other 'religions'. I find that the ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can be interpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that 'mysticism' is the core of every religion and Huxley's 'Perennial Philosophy' is the Great Secret Core of all mystical trads. :> Tony: I'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium Rosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this newsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in San Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I looked). Of course, "most members" does not *necessarily* mean "best". Response: Certainly true. I didn't know there WERE any groups which called themselves 'Rosicrucians' that didn't associate with AMORC. Sure, I've heard all the hubbub about the Golden Dawn and Rosae Crucis in relation to all these Western esoteric groups, but hadn't heard about other 'Rosicrucians'. I'll admit my bias. I live in San Jose. :> Tony: "You'll have to trust me" when I tell you that if that lecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you would have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a positive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO. Response: This may be slightly off. I've met some of these Rosicrucians and have a couple friends in AMORC. The stories I've heard and the slight contact I've had with them does not give me the hope that I'd be received with any kind of warm welcome. I still like to think that most people who are involved with stratified relationships (monogamy, religion, etc.) are in DEEP pain and hope to heal it within such a 'cast'. Tony: It is curious to know that 3 other RC 'orders' (in the USA) claim to be *non- sectarian*. Response: I'd like to know at least the addresses of the 'other orders' which call themselves 'Rosicrucians' and especially those which are 'nonsectarian'. Is this 'nonsectarian' like the Masons, who require that a member 'believe in God by his/her definition'? Tony: I don't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with "us containing something divine"...

Got it in one. Similarly, a moral relativist will not judge one moral system to be better than another in every possible circumstance. This does not, however, preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than another in a specific set of circumstances.

In his infinite wisdom, he made it perfectly clear that if we don't live according to his rules, we will burn in hell. Well, with what RIGHT can god make that desicion? Let's say, for the sake of argument, that god creates every one of us (directly or indirectly, it doesn't matter.). What then happens, is that he first creates us, and then turns us lose. Well, I didn't ask to be created. Let's make an analogue. If a scientist creates a unique living creature (which has happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the right to expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...? Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep, unable to do otherwise that follow the rest? Hmmmmmmmmmmmm. I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, I mean it.

It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of good will. The latter do so in love, knowing that I am put here for the gospel. The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am chains. But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice.

It seems you lived a fairly 'wild life'-- my background is far more traditional, mostly working, working, working. Maybe there's a clear indication that the way you lived your life produced a certain amount of anxiety that needed to be released. Religion was one possible medicine.

It is >discriminatory that I cannot make that choice, and so you must pay for it." >That a person has a right to make a choice does not imply legally or >otherwise that someone else should Foot the Bill [sic] for that choice. Ok, look. It's like this. We *are* footing the bill. Maybe they will take choice A. Maybe they will take choice B. Maybe they will take choice C. They can't afford any *one* of them. If they take choice A we'd have to pay them, say $5. If they take choice B it would cost us $20. If they take choice C it will cost us $20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next 18 years. Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay for? Now some people happen not to like choice A. Other people happen not to like choice C (paying for it, that is). C has been around and paid for for years. Even though it means we spend a lot of money, we can't in conscience refuse to pay for it. Now A has been around and is perfectly legal, but it hasn't been funded in the past. Now A is going to be funded but some people object. They don't like the idea of their tax money going to pay for choice A. So we could refuse to fund A at all. Then those women who can't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice B or C, which will cost *all of us* more money. Most of us don't see any reason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removing personal choice* from some women. The alternative is to fund A if that is what the mother chooses. We will also still fund B and even C if *that* is what the mother chooses. However, some women will certainly choose A, and that will then save us $15 we otherwise would have had to spend. Your "taxes" are not being raised to fund a choice you object, they are being *lowered* because we will fund a choice that is *legal*, despite your objections to it. (Actually, your taxes are not really going to go down, as I'm sure you would point out. But the amount that is saved in that area can help out in another--like our massive debt.) >>If you disagree then give us some "reasons". Given that abortion is >>*LEGAL* and the right to abortion is supported by the majority of the >>population ... >>...it is not justifiable to refuse abortions to women who can not afford >>them, who will simply require even greater funds for the delivery you >>would force upon them.

Uncle Bill doesn't pay for >breast augmentation, facelifts, etc... Why abortions? It's elective >surgery! Those other procedures you mention only cost money. There is no savings in other procedures that would be required down the road without them. (In fact, there could be additional costs down the road *because* of them.) This is quite different from the case of abortion. >As for your argument, you are enticing a young girl to kill a baby by making >it affordable and refusing to make the alternative affordable too, SO YOU >ARE JUST AS GUILTY OF REMOVING A CHOICE BY WITHHOLDING FUNDS! Think about >it. A poor girl is pregnant and abortions are federally funded, what's she >gonna do. What choice have YOUR PLANS given her. Your kind of double- >talk really makes me ill. This is bullshit. We are *not* refusing "to make the alternative affordable too". If we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth, *then* your statement would make sense. But that is not the case, so it doesn't. If Clinton tried to block funding for pre-natal care and delivery (or left it out of his health-care plan), I would certainly object. I would also be quite surprised. >"Pro-choice". Ha! Pro-Abortion really fits in your case. Yes, but probably not your definition of it, or for the reasons you think. >If you're gonna fund one choice, you have to fund them all, at the very >least. YOU STUPID FUCK! *WE DO* want to fund *all* the choices. *YOU* are the one who wants to *NOT* fund all the choices. > IMHO if we fund the adoption choice right, (meaning not just >throwing money at it but cutting costs, esp. legal costs) we won't need >abortion anymore. Your humble opinion is still wrong. Even with easy adoption, there is still the fact that pregnancy takes several months. Months in which a young woman could need to be getting an education. (like finishing High School, entering college, finishing college, getting a job...things that are much harder to do if you have to "take a break" for a few months...things that have a massive impact on her future productivity.) >>have a "right to life".

In addition to the change in title, the revised ETR BOM has been shortened by several pages (eliminating many extraneous "that's" and "of's"), and many (minor) errors have been corrected. This release includes a simplified Joseph Smith Story, testimonies of the three and eight witnesses, and a "Words-to-Know" glossary. As with the previous announcement, readers are reminded that this is a not-for-profit endeavor. This is a copyrighted work, but people are welcome to make *verbatim* copies for personal use. People can recuperate the actual costs of printing (paper, copy center charges), but may not charge anything for their time in making copies, or in any way realize a profit from the use of this book. See the permissions notice in the book itself for the precise terms. Negotiations are currently underway with a Mormon publisher vis-a-vis the printing and distribution of bound books. (Sorry, I'm out of the wire-bound "first editions.") I will make another announcement about the availability of printed copies once everything has been worked out. FTP information: connect via anonymous ftp to carnot.itc.cmu.edu, then "cd pub" (you won't see anything at all until you do). "The Easy-to-Read Book of Mormon" is currently available in postscript and RTF (rich text format). (ASCII, LaTeX, and other versions can be made available; contact dba@andrew.cmu.edu for details.) You should be able to print the postscript file on any postscript printer (such as an Apple Laserwriter); let dba know if you have any difficulties. (The postscript in the last release had problems on some printers; this time it should work better.) RTF is a standard document interchange format that can be read in by a number of word processors, including Microsoft Word for both the Macintosh and Windows. If you don't have a postscript printer, you may be able to use the RTF file to print out a copy of the book. -r--r--r-- 1 dba 1984742 Apr 27 13:12 etrbom.ps -r--r--r-- 1 dba 1209071 Apr 27 13:13 etrbom.rtf For more information about how this project came about, please refer to my article in the current issue of _Sunstone_, entitled "Delighting in Plainness: Issues Surrounding a Simple Modern English Book of Mormon."

No. The library at Alexandria was perhaps the greatest library ever built in the world. The Greeks had a love of wisdom, philo sophos, and this great love was reflected in the Alexandrian library. The Christians got a hold of it and began modifying and purging texts and then the Moslems invaded and either the Christians burned the library to keep it from falling into Moslems hands (far more likely since they were the book burners, not the Moslems), or it burned in the sack of the city or the Moslems burned it. Either way, a tremendous amount of information was lost.

Elizabeth Bartley) writes: >I can certainly see opposing the "Amen" -- but that doesn't require >opposing a moment of silence. I already responded to this on one dimension, but afterthoughts cause me to make another, independent reply. The problem with a "moment of silence" is that it is NOT an even-handed way of "allowing" for religion amongst students in the public schools. As I noted before, Muslims need more than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are required by Muhammad to do. And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer also has requirements that are not addressed by this. There is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in this "moment of silence" shit. And that is especially bizarre in that Christian prayer DOESN'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally incognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews as well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some characteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special times and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer being able taking note of it.) A Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of his activity being evident to others. That may or may not be true of the other religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME forms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant "mainstream" religion. All that a "moment of silence" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which doesn't NEED it, to have a "special" place set aside in the public schools. There is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs, or phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world. A Christian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during the day, without anyone else knowing it. [That may also be true of non- Christians -- I am not claimng otherwise]. In the "moment of silence" it would STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims to do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed forms. But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore, the provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that. Luckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as a Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools), and a growing Muslim presence as well. I can only hope that the political forces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms on non-Christians. As far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this "moment of silence" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE children to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity. And as a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion. For what it's worth, I suspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians -- it is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in "making" their children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach what THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in the world to do so. If you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment of silence in school. If you have NOT managed to teach them, the moment will only embarrass you. Give it up. -- Michael L.

233	From: neese@cerritos.edu Subject: Hell Distribution: world Organization: Cerritos College, Norwalk CA Lines: 110 In the King James Version of the Bible there are three differents words translated into the word "hell". These Greek words have totally different meanings. The words are Hades, Tartaros, and Gehenna. In bibical usage, the Greek word Hades is used only 11 times in the New Testament, and is roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol... meaning the grave or pit (compare Acts 2:27 with Psalms 16:10). Hades may be likened to a hole in the ground. (In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire!) Most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the English word hell to translate Hades and Sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice. Why? Because when seeing the word "hell" many readers impute to it the traditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno, when this was never remotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English! In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of the dead, but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of "shadowy realm." Hades is simply the abode we call the grave. All dead go to this hell. The second "hell" of the Bible, Tartaros, is mentioned only once in scripture, 2 Pet.2:4; "For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell (TARTAROS), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment..." Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne (Isa.14:12-14; Rev.12:4), the archangel Lucifer (now Satan) and a third of the created angels (now demons) were ejected from heaven (Luke 10:18). They were cast down to Tartaros, a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the mutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment (Jude 6; 1 Cor.6:3). Tartaros, then, is a "hell" that applies only to evil, rebellious angels or demons (It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe the place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans). Nowhere in the Bible is there any mention of men being put into this particular "hell". The the third word that is translated as "hell" in the Bible is Gehenna. It comes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM, meaning "valley of Hinniom." Hinnom is a deep, narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem. In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites, including infant sacrifice (It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made their children "pass through the fire" to the god Molech. The rites were specifically celebrated in Tophet, the "place of abhorrence," one of the chief groves in the valley). King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations. He defiled the valley, rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 Kings 23:10). Later the valley became the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem; a repository for sewage, refuse and animal carcasses. The bodies of dispised criminals were also burned there along with the rubbish. Fires burned continuously, feeding by a constant supply of garbage and refuse. Aceldama, the "field of blood", purchased with the money Judas received for the betrayal of Christ (Matt.27:8) was also in part of the valley of Hinnom. So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell? In Rev.19:20: the Satan inspired political dictator and a miracle-working religious figure, the False Prophet, working with him will resist the re-establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at His Second Coming. Their fate is revealed by the apostle John: "And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet... These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone." Where will this temporary lake of fire (this "hell") be? The prophet Isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the Beast: "For Tophet (in the valley of Hinnom) is ordained of old, yea for the king it is prepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and wood, the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it" (Isa.30:33). One thousand years later, Satan himself will be cast into this rekindled fiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet were cast! (Rev.20:10). But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia? Does the Bible say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of fire? In the sequence of Rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be thrown into the lake of fire after Satan is cast there! (Rev.20:15). What will become of these wicked? Will they writhe in flames for eternity? The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna fire on the earth. They wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed! This punishment will be everlasting (permanent and final). The Bible calls it the "second death" (Rev.20:14; 21:8), from which there is no possibility of a further resurrection. The Bible does teach eternal punishment, but not eternal punishing. The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description. "For, behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up..." (4:1). To the righteous, God says that the wicked shall be "ashes under the soles of your feet..."(Mal.4:3). Gehenna was a place of destruction and death, not a place of living torture! Jesus was talking to Jews who understood all about this Gehenna or valley of Hinnom. Utter destruction by fire was complete. Nothing was left, but ashes! Every text in the Bible translated from this Greek word Gehenna means complete destruction, not living torture (not eternal life in torment)! The Bible says, in Romans 6:23, "The wages of sin is death", not eternal life in torture. The punishment revealed in the Bible is Death... the cessation of life. Eternal life is the GIFT OF GOD!	3

I only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a conviction. I am not certain what you mean by the "fundy" part as the term fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses. If you refer to those who actually believe Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God and wish to follow in his way, then I plead guilty. But what does it matter what I think. The Roman circus is over. The lions have been satisfied -- for now. The Emperor, after the long and gruelling struggle, sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down. With respect to my previous comments about David Koresh, I urge you to re-examine my previous posts. I believe you mistakenly assume that defense of Koresh' right to his own personal beliefs and his right to express them to others implies agreement with Koresh' theology. Actually I understand little about the details of Branch- Davidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspect of the tragic events of the past few days. Nor do I think Koresh' sex life should be of any interest to the federal government. Of course Hillary says he had been molesting infants so it must be true even though such allegations do not fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government; they are state and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the local level by proper authorities with no successful charge having ever been levied against him. Under American law, he was innocent as Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty. At least that's how it is suppposed to be. But he was demonized and propa- gandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a lustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might bring upon him. But evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children, who left the building in the early days of the siege, were carefully examined by qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse and none was found. DeGuerin, one of the attorneys who met with Davidians several times before the conflagration, reported that the children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse. Ultimately, Steve, what I think about the heart of David Koresh is quite unimportant. Today he is in the benevolent hands of a most wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all. So I withhold any judgment of David Koresh and defer to the One who has all knowledge. Meanwhile, let's clean up the mess left on earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strong message to the government to respect the inalienable rights of the people it serves. --Joe Gaut > > (I remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire: I wouldn't > put it past Koresh to have torched the place himself.

Are we to >simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it? Rick, I think we can safely say, 1) Robert is not the only person who understands the Bible, and 2), the leadership of the LDS church historicly never has. Let's consider some "personal interpretations" and see how much trust we should put in "Orthodox Mormonism", which could never be confused with Orthodox Christianity. In one of his attacks on Christians, the Mormon Apostle Bruce R. McConkie said they "thrash around in...darkness in trying to identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised Messiah." He also said Christians are wrong to believe "that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity [God the Father]," and that Christ "came into mortality" as His "Only Begotten" Son. McConkie then stated what Mormons believe today to be the truth about the matter. He said that "Elohim is the Father" and "Jehovah is the Son." "Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah. (Promised Messiah, p. 100) Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about their "three-in-one God" and their belief that "God is a Spirit" as they are in their understanding of who "Elohim" and "Jehovah" are. Before examining McConkie's attack and its validity, we shall read a few more statements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words "Elohim" and "Jehovah." McConkie stated: "...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367) "_Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon Doctrine, p. 224) Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who "Elohim" and "Jehovah" are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated: "_Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh, Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38) "A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve" apostles of the Mormon Church states that "God the Eternal Father...[is] designate[d] by the exalted name-title 'Elohim'..." (Articles of Faith, p. 466) "...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied state...was known as Jehovah..." (Articles of Faith, p. 471) Today Mormon leaders teach that "Elohim" in the OT refers to God the Father and "Jehovah" refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christians for saying "Jehovah" can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two "name-titles" should not be changed around so that Christ is called "Elohim" and the Father is called "Jehovah." "...the Father...is Elohim, not Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are one and the same person." (Promised Messiah, p. 111) In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word "Elohim" is used to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judges of Israel. When referring to the true God, "Elohim" is translated with a capital "G." When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges of Israel, it is translated with a small "g." It is translated four times as "judges" (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as "judge" (1 Sam. 2:25), twice as "mighty" (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as "angels" (Ps. 8:5), once as "godly" (Mal. 2:15), once as "great" (Gen. 30:8), and once as "very great." (1 Sam. 14:15) The word "Jehovah" is the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word "Adonai." Many people believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since "Jehovah" rather than Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use "Jehovah" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of Mormon leaders regarding that name. "Jehovah," unlike "Elohim," is never used of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the Bible. In the KJV, "Jehovah" is rendered primarily "LORD," sometimes "GOD," and rarely "Lord." Now that we understand something about the words "Elohim" and "Jehovah" and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the Apostle McConkie's attack on Christians for believing the Father is "Jehovah." In trying to prove that "Jehovah" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie cited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie's interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right. Remember, McConkie said the Father is not "Jehovah;" He is only "Elohim." The first example we shall consider involves McConkie's interpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated: "Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit and he testified, "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?" (Ps. 110:1.) Two Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this Messianic prophecy? "What think ye of Christ?" our Lord asked certain of his detractors toward the end of his mortal ministry. "Whose son is he?" Is Christ the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the Jews. And so they answered, "The Son of David." David's son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture, asked, "How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake unto David's Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: '_The Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to sit on my right hand forever.' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102) (emphasis added) Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following remark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6 reads: "The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the Son]..." (brackets in original) McConkie clearly stated that it is "Elohim" the Father who is speaking to "Jehovah" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at the Hebrew word translated "LORD," it becomes apparent that either the first "LORD" is not the Father or else the Father is "Jehovah." Either way McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads: "The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1) The first "LORD" in this verse is "Jehovah" who Mormonism says is Christ, not the Father. The second "Lord" is the Hebrew word "Adon" (singular for "Adonai," meaning master or lord). If the first "LORD" is the Father and the second "Lord" is the Son, then the Father is "Jehovah" and the Son is "Adon." However, if the Father is not "Jehovah" as McConkie claimed, then the first "LORD" is "Jehovah" the Son, but who, then, is "Adon?" Obviously the Father is "Jehovah" in this Psalm, and His Son is "Adon." Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated the following: "I the Lord have called thee in righteousness," _Isaiah quoted the Father as saying of Christ_, "and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles." (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added) McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage which reads: "I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6) According to McConkie, "I the LORD" refers to the Father, and "thine" and "thee" refer to Christ. However, the "LORD" who is speaking is "Jehovah" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking or else the Father is "Jehovah." Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie stated: "The same Psalm says: "All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him." (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is found in these words: "The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth." (Matt. 27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added) Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows: "All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him. McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment "as Jesus hung on the cross." That means the person who was scorned in these verses was Christ. Who, then, was the "LORD" in whom he trusted? It was "Jehovah" the Father. Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them, McConkie stated the following: "With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our Lord's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: "They took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life." (Ps. 31:13.) As to the role of Judas in those conspiracies, the Psalmist says: "Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me." (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised Messiah, p. 532) Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ's "arrest and judicial trials." We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While McConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included to give a complete understanding of the matter. "For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14) McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes on to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the "LORD" who is called His "God" or "Elohim." Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is "Elohim" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the "Elohim" of the man Jesus is "Jehovah" the Father. In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses will be considered in this examination. "Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me. But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10) McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas' role in Christ's death. Since it was Judas who was the "familiar friend" who "lifted up his heel," the pronouns "mine," "I," "my," and "me" in verse 9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there is a change of pronoun to "thou," which refers to the "LORD" (Jehovah). Then the pronouns "me" and "I" which refer to Christ are used again. That means Christ was speaking to "Jehovah" the Father in these verses. Another example involves McConkie's following remark about Ps. 110:4. "One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David, says: "The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek." (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 450) McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ. The question is, What in this verse refers to Christ? "The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4) Does the "LORD," which is "Jehovah," refer to Christ? If McConkie is right and Jesus is "Jehovah," but the Father is not, then the "LORD" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one addressed as the "priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?" The Bible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10; 6:20; 7); therefore, the "LORD" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father. Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie stated: "Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said... The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all.... It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234) (emphasis added) McConkie rightly said these verses refer to "the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah." However, what he failed to mention is that they also prove that the Father is "Jehovah." Verse 6 reads: "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us all," and verse 10 reads: "Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise him [Christ]..." Obviously the "LORD" who laid on Christ "the iniquity of us all" and who bruised Him is God the Father who is called "Jehovah" in these verses. Remember, McConkie stated that "some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity," and that Christ "came into mortality" as His "Only Begotten" Son. He called this concept "misinformation" that is "untrue." To prove that it is McConkie who is misinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam. 7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding these Scriptures: "In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of the Seed of David: "I will be his father, and he shall be my son." (2 Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly Messianic, occurs this statement: "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee." (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143) McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7 refer to Christ who "would come as the Son of God." Since McConkie first referenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with verse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included. "And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house. And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2 Sam. 7:11-14) These verses teach that the "LORD" (Jehovah) would have a Son, the Messiah. In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination will include verse 8. Notice that it is the "LORD" (Jehovah) who says, "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee." "I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. McConkie said these verses of Scripture are "clearly Messianic," and he acknowledged they teach that "Christ would come as the Son of God." What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these Scriptures also teach that the Father is "Jehovah" and that the "sectarians" who believe "Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son" is Jesus Christ, "the Only Begotten," are right in their belief. Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie stated the following: "And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly, this is he of whom it is written_: "He shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth." (Mic. 5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added) According to McConkie, the pronoun "He" at the beginning of Mic. 5:4 refers to Christ "during his mortal ministry." Who, then, is the "LORD his God?" Mic. 5:4 reads: "And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth. Obviously the "LORD" of Jesus Christ is "Jehovah" the Father who is referred to as "Jehovah his Elohim." Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses McConkie stated the following: "A number of Messianic passages speak of "the Lord, and...his anointed" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah's prophecy. "The Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek" (Isa. 61:1), and then saying: "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added) The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows: "The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed. McConkie said the "anointed" one was Christ. If that is true, who was "Jehovah?" If "Jehovah" is always Christ, who was the "anointed" one? Obviously "Jehovah" is referring to God the Father and the "anointed" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie cited is Isa. 61:1 which states: "The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open was Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse says the "LORD" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same problem. If "Jehovah" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ, then Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, "Jesus applied these passages to himself." Therefore, the "Jehovah" who anointed Christ is God the Father. Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other Mormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not "Jehovah." However, these should be enough to expose their error. Now, what about Mormonism's claim that Jesus is "Jehovah," but He is not "Elohim?" It is true that Jesus is "Jehovah." The following Scriptures prove this fact: "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God. (Isa. 44:6) [Jesus said] ...I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and was dead... (Rev. 1:17-18) "...saith the LORD [Jehovah]...they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son... (Zech. 12:1,10) Behold, he [Christ] cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him... (Rev. 1:7) "...I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel... (Isa. 43:3) ...Ye denied the Holy One [Christ] and the Just... (Acts 3:14) "And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD [Jehovah] shall be delivered... (Joel 2:32) "...the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:10,12) "Behold, the Lord GOD [Jehovah] will come with strong hand...his reward is with him... (Isa. 40:10) ...Behold, I [Christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me... (Rev. 22:12) "...the LORD [Jehovah] my God shall come, and all the saints with thee. (Zech. 14:5) "...at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints. (1 Thess. 3:13) "The LORD [Jehovah] is my shepherd... (Ps. 23:1) [Jesus said] I am the good shepherd... (John 10:14) "...saith the Lord GOD [Jehovah]. I will seek that which was lost... (Ezek. 34:15-16) ...the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. (Luke 19:10) "For I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour... (Isa. 43:3) Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. (Tit. 2:13. See also Jer. 42:5 and Rev. 1:5; Mal. 3:6 and Heb. 13:8; 1 Kin. 8:28,39 and John 2:24-25; Isa. 25:8 and 2 Tim. 1:10; Ps. 107:24,29 and Matt. 8:26; Prov.3:12 and Rev. 3:19) While Mormons are right when they say Jesus is "Jehovah," they are wrong when they say He is not "Elohim." The Bible reveals that "Jehovah" is the only true "Elohim" there is; all others are false. Remember, "Jehovah" is the personal name of the triune God who has revealed Himself in the Bible. Before we consider Biblical quotes which show that "Jehovah" and "Elohim" are not two separate gods as Mormons claims let us first note that not only are both God the Father and Christ addressed as "Jehovah" and "Elohim" but so is the Holy Spirit. "Whereof the _Holy Ghost_..._said_...This _is_ the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. (Heb. 10:15-17) (emphasis on "Holy Ghost" and "said" added) Behold, the days come, _saith the LORD_ [Jehovah], that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah... I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God [Elohim], and they shall be my people.... I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. (Jer. 31:31,33-34) (emphasis added) "For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the _Holy Ghost_. (2 Pet. 1:21) (emphasis on "Holy Ghost" added) "The Spirit of the LORD [Jehovah] spake by me, and his word was in my tongue. (2 Sam. 23:2. See also Heb. 3:7-11 with Ps. 95:6-11) Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that "Jehovah" and "Elohim" are not two separate gods as Mormons claim. "And when the LORD [Jehovah] saw that he [Moses] turned aside to see, God [Elohim] called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.... [Bruce R. McConkie acknowledged that "it was" Christ's "voice that spoke to Moses in the burning bush..." Promised Messiah, p. 394] And the LORD [Jehovah] said... And Moses said unto God [Elohim], Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God [Elohim] of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? And God [Elohim] said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. And God [Elohim] said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of your fathers, the God [Elohim] of Abraham, the God [Elohim] of Isaac, and the God [Elohim] of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. (Exod. 3:4,7,13-15) "And God [Elohim] spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD [Jehovah]. (Exod. 6:2) "I am the LORD [Jehovah], and there is none else, there is no God [Elohim] beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me: (Isa. 45:5) "But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God [Elohim], and an everlasting king... (Jer. 10:10) "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God [Elohim]. (Isa. 44:6) "Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD [Jehovah], whose name is The God [Elohim] of hosts. (Amos 5:27) "Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's [Jehovah's] thy God [Elohim], the earth also, with all that therein is. (Deut. 10:14) "Wherefore thou art great, O LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim]: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God [Elohim] beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. (2 Sam. 7:22) "And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land. (Jon. 1:9) "For who is God [Elohim] save the LORD [Jehovah]? or who is a rock save our God [Elohim]? (Ps. 18:31) "Blessed is the nation whose God [Elohim] is the LORD [Jehovah]... (Ps. 33:12. See also Ps. 144:15) "Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God [Elohim], the LORD [Jehovah], the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding. (Isa. 40:28) "The mighty God [Elohim], even the LORD [Jehovah], hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. (Ps. 50:1) "Sing unto God [Elohim], sing praises to his name: estol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him. (Ps. 68:4) [Regarding the word "Jah," Bruce R. McConkie stated: "Jah (Hebrew Yah) is a contracted form of Jehovah, Jahveh, or Yahweh -- all of which names have reference to Christ, the God of Israel." Mormon Doctrine, p. 391] "And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God [Elohim], whose name is called by the name of the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims. (2 Sam. 6:2) "...the Great the Mighty God [Elohim], the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, is his name. (Jer. 32:18) "O my God [Elohim], make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.... Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD [Jehovah].... That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth. (Ps. 83:13,16,18) The Bible clearly teaches that "Jehovah" is "Elohim." In fact, He is the only "Elohim" there is. He is the "true," the "living," the "mighty," the "great," and the "everlasting Elohim." He is the "Elohim" of Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. He is the Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and all that dwell thereon. "Jehovah's" name is "Elohim of hosts." (Amos 5:27) Not only is "Jehovah," "Elohim," but "Elohim" is "Jehovah." The Bible reveals that "Elohim's" name is "Jah" (Ps. 68:4), "Jehovah" (Ps. 83:18), and "Jehovah of hosts." (2 Sam. 6:2; Jer. 32:18) The nation whose "Elohim" is "Jehovah" is blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is not the "Jehovah" and "Elohim" of the Mormons. Another Mormon error regarding "Elohim" and "Jehovah" is the belief that "Elohim," not "Jehovah," is the Father of all the spirits, including Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage, "A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve" apostles states that "God the Eternal Father...'Elohim,' is the literal Parent of...the spirits of the human race." (p. 466) This "Doctrinal Exposition" also states explicitly that "Jesus Christ is not the Father of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth, for He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of Elohim." (p. 473) The Apostle Talmage stated that "_Elohim_...is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_--" (Jesus the Christ, p. 38) The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this matter: "...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms of plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came to placing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, the Father himself became personally involved. All things were created by the Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In the spirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There was no delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was concerned." (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added) Mormon leaders claim that "Jehovah-Christ" did not create either man's spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon "Elohim," who is the father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals the truth about who created man. "And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying, Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. See also 16:20-23) (emphasis added) "...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within him_. (Zech. 12:1) (emphasis added) "...the LORD [Jehovah]...made us this soul... (Jer. 38:16) "For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the _souls which I have made_.... ...saith the LORD [Jehovah]... (Isa. 57:16,19) (emphasis on "souls...I have made" added) "Behold, I am the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] _of all flesh_... (Jer. 32:27) (emphasis added) "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that _formed thee from the womb_. I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things... (Isa. 44:24) (emphasis added) "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah]... I have made the earth, and _created man_ upon it... (Isa. 45:11-12) (emphasis added) "...God [Elohim] created man upon the earth... Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD [Jehovah] he is God [Elohim]; there is none else beside him. (Deut. 4:32,35) "Thus saith God [El] the LORD [Jehovah]...he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein. (Isa. 42:5) "...Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, the God [Elohim] of Israel... I have made the earth, _the man_ and the beast that are upon the ground... (Jer. 27:4-5) (most emphasis added) The Bible reveals that it is "Jehovah" who is the "Elohim of the spirits of all flesh" and "of all flesh" itself, that it was He who "formed the spirit of man within him," that He "made us this soul" and "formed us from the womb." He did indeed "create man." If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is "Jehovah," then they are wrong when they say he did not create man. If they are right when they say the father is the one who created man, then they are wrong when they say he is not "Jehovah." Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man, Mormon scriptures teach that he did. The BoM states the following: "Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son.... And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_, for never has man believed in me as thou hast.... Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit... (Eth. 3:14-16) (emphasis added) "For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is _I that hath created them_... (Mos. 26:23) (emphasis added) "...the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob...is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. Behold _he created Adam_... (Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added) D&C, 93:10 states that "the worlds were made by him [Christ]; _men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him, and of him." (emphasis added) Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving "Jehovah" and his creation is the belief that "Jehovah" had "many" pre-mortal spirits helping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr. "That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by "many of the noble and great" spirit children of the Father is evident from Abraham's writings. Unto those superior spirits Christ said: "We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell." (Abra. 3:22-24.) Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other "noble and great" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169) The Bible reveals the truth about this matter: "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself. (Isa. 44:24) "Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. (Job 9:8) "Jehovah," by Himself, created all things. He had no alleged preexistent spirit helpers assisting Him. Regarding the Mormon 'Elohim," the Apostle McConkie stated: "Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods." (Mormon Doctrine, p. 224) He also stated that "Jesus...is above all save the Father only." (Promised Messiah, p. 363) The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called gods is the triune God "Jehovah." "For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3) "For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9) "Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17) If Mormon leaders are right when they say "Jehovah" is god the son and "Elohim" is god the father, these verses from the Bible would be teaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkie clearly stated, Mormons believe "Elohim" the father, not "Jehovah" the son, is the "God above all Gods" -- that Jesus is above all except the father; yet the Bible teaches that "Jehovah" is above all "Elohim." At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made the following remark about praying to Jesus: "Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been developed.... This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the Father, and to him only.... ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son; it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With the Lord, pp. 19-20) McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the Mormons "pray to the Father, not the Son..." On p. 306 of the same book McConkie states that "Christ [the Son] is Jehovah." This is important to remember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to the Mormon Christ who is "Jehovah," the Bible states repeatedly in the OT that people prayed to "Jehovah," and He not only heard those prayers, but He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a small sample of the vast number of times people prayed to "Jehovah." "In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6) "And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3) "And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2) "O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11) "And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54) "He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33) "Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5) "I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD [Jehovah]; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found... (Ps. 32:5-6) Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the "godly" pray to "Jehovah." According to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the very one to whom McConkie said people should not pray. The Bible reveals there is only one true "Elohim," and His name is "Jehovah." All other "Elohim" are false. They are idols that cause their followers to commit adultery against the true "Elohim" and idolatry. "For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods [Elohim]. For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD [Jehovah] made the heavens. (Ps. 96:4-5) "Thou shalt have no other gods [Elohim] before me. (Exod. 20:3) "Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11) "And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish. (Deut. 8:19) "Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods [Elohim]. They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods [Elohim], it will surely be a snare unto thee. (Exod. 23:32- 33) "Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods [Elohim], and worship them. (Deut. 11:16) "That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods [Elohim], nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them. (Josh. 23:7) "...neither walk after other gods [Elohim] to your hurt. (Jer. 7:6) "But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God [Elohim]... (Jer. 10:10) "And they forsook the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods [Elohim], of the gods [Elohim] of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD [Jehovah] to anger. (Jud. 2:12) "Shall a man make gods [Elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods [Elohim]? Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is the LORD [Jehovah]. ( Jer. 16:20-21) "And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD [Jehovah], choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods [Elohim] which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods [Elohim] of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD [Jehovah]. And the people answered and said, God [Elohim] forbid that we should forsake the LORD [Jehovah], to serve other gods [Elohim]. (Josh. 24:15-16) These verses teach that the only true, living "Elohim" in heaven and on earth is "Jehovah" -- the triune God who made heaven and earth and all therein. "Jehovah" is greater than any "Elohim," because all other "Elohim" are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17) "Jehovah Elohim" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding these false "Elohim." He told His people not to have any "Elohim" but Him. He told the people that if they left Him for the false "Elohim," those "Elohim" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and would perish. He warned the people to "take heed" that their "heart be not deceived" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making covenants with false "Elohim." "Jehovah Elohim" told His people He would eventually judge all false "Elohim" and their followers. Despite these warnings and guidelines, "Elohim's" covenant people forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false "Elohim's" of the people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that "the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods [Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim] of the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him." This examination has shown that the "Elohim" of Mormonism, like the "Elohim" in Ju. 10:6 is not the true "Jehovah Elohim." Therefore, the people who leave the true "Elohim" for the Mormon "Elohim" will do "evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah]." Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a triune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father [Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God is triune; He is Spirit; He is "Jehovah;" and He did send His Son into the world to redeem mankind. It is obvious from this examination that it is not the Christians who "thrash around in...darkness" about who "Elohim" and "Jehovah" are. One wonders what "Holy Writ" McConkie had in mind when he stated that it attests to the fact that "Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son." He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one "Jehovah Elohim." He apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses 1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as "Jehovah." Summary Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith's statement that the Mormons "have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God" (Doctrines of Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the true God as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to commit adultery against God and idolatry. In answer to Jesus' question, "But whom say ye that I am," Mormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in the Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting in the Mormon Jesus is believing in "another Jesus" whom Paul warned about. Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy, admitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, that the Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus. He stated that "it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different Jesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." (p. 26) The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing adultery against God and idolatry. They do not have the Son; therefore, they do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As the Apostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: "Salvation comes only by worshiping the true God." (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie also rightly stated that "the mere worship of a god who has the proper scriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and living God," because the "true names of Deity" can be applied to "false concepts of God." (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the Apostle Stephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave "a new conception of God and the Godhead." (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p. 1) It is important for the people who have left the true triune God revealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake the sins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism. The Bible says: "...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD [Jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (Jer. 17:13) "And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish. (Deut. 8:19) "Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32) "...Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments. (Gen. 35:2) "...flee from idolatry. (1 Cor. 10:14) It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible. If they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and idolatry. Remember, to know the "only true God" is eternal life. (John 17:3) "...their gods [Elohim] shall be a snare unto you." (Ju. 2:3. See also Exod. 23:32-33)	3

Well, the best thing to do is to read the book "Parallel Universes" by Dr. Fred Wolf. In essence, Dr. Wolf says that one interpretation of the sub-atomic particle/wave duality is that what we perceive as a wave is actually an infinate number of parallel universes overlaid, and in each of these universes there is a particle in a different location. When we do something to make a particle "appear," we are actually causing all the parallel universes to collapse into one. Apparently this is one line of thought on the nature of QM, that is going through some of the scientific community. Dr. Wolf (and many others) claim that somehow the collapse is caused by the mental effort of observing the particle. This implys that mind is more than merely a biological phenomenon. He then extrapolates that if mind is an integral part of the universe, then perhaps consciousness is the element that gives order and form to the universe(s) it/themself(s). It all gets rather interesting, but what I find facinating is that this would explain the phenomenon of "magick" as practiced in my religion. Dr. Wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mind could be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number of possible futures; he says that this might be done by some sort of communication between ones current, and possible future selves. I have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of self delusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selection of one of many possible futures. I realize that this gets pretty bizarre, but it never hurts to keep an open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile explaination of the world in which we find ourselves. After all, the more we learn about the universe in which we live, the more we learn that it is truly a very strange place. >Nanci eric	3

We have the contradictory word of the lawyers who spoke with the survivors individually that ALL of them agreed that they did NOT have a suicide pact and did not intentionally start the fire.

With all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and the adults wearing gas masks, it had to have been chaotic inside.

I personally can't really asses any relative probablities to either of these 3 probabilities although if forced to bet on the issue, I would probably take an accident (either FBI or BD) over intential setting of the fire). I would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recovered had gunshot wounds. The coroner was on the Today Show this morning and categorically denied that they've reach any such conclusions. He pointed out that under intense heat, sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is quite consisted with te reports I've read and heard. In short, there's been almost no evidence corroborating any of the many scenarios as to what happened on Monday.

Such things are derived from Biblcal texts through the centuries by the apocolic fathers of the faith. You are right that people read things differently in the Bible, and this is alright in parts like parables and such forth. However, when it comes to the essential doctrines of the Historical Orthodox Christan Beliefs, there is only one correct way to read it. For example, either the doctrine of the Trinity is true, or it is false. Yes, people read the texts differently, but only one position is true. They both cannot be. According to the text, the doctrine is true and has always existed. Therefore, when people like Joseph Smith come along with a vision and thinks he can undo centuries of a doctrine that is supported by the Bible, people consider him a cult.	3

Maybe I'm just not compatible with Christianity. I just refuse to follow rules blindly, and since I can't even convince myself that your god even EXISTS in the way you describe it, I've got to just follow my own conscience in these matters. >I know how that goes.

Since then, I've never abandoned the possibility that maybe your supernatural trinity does exist.

Our entire universe might just be an electron in a four- dimensional universe, which in turn may only be an insignificant speck in a universe above that, and so on and so forth until the variables become too much for us to even speculate on. That is, there's no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to be, so there's no reason at all to believe that your God exists nor had anything to do with it. >"OK," you may say.

Maybe you'll say that your religion doesn't teach that -- but I've got to judge Christianity from the Christians I know. I feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one's self, and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason than that. So I hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some people think. I want Christians to realize that there are perfectly valid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity whatsoever, and I want people who are considering Christianity to realize that Christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy, fulfilled life. I have known some very nice Christians who have done some very nice things. I think what sets these people apart from the general masses is that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong, and they know the weaknesses of their religion, yet they still decide to believe, but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think any less of people who don't agree with them. >Obviously, the debate on the veracity and reliability of the Source of the >Christian's faith is far from conclusive, notwithstanding how vehemently we >propose otherwise.

If one is to use the Bible as a reference, one must always be open to different interpretations. As a Christian, I have the Spirit of God to verify what I believe in the Word. If what the Spirit tells me is not backed up in scripture then the spirit I am communicating with is not of God.

If you choose to jump off a cliff, you can hardly blame God for you going *splat* at the bottom. He knows that if you choose to jump, that you will die but He will not prevent you from making that choice. In fact, He sent His Son to stand on the edge of the cliff and tell everyone of what lies below. To prove that point, Jesus took that plunge Himself but He being God was able to rise up again. I have seen the example of Christ and have chosen not to jump and I'm trying to tell you not to jump or else you'll go *splat*. You don't have to listen to me and I won't stop you if you decide to jump. I only ask that you check it out before taking the plunge. You owe it to yourself. I don't like seeing anyone go *splat*.

The rest of the story seems to be that the agreement for the broadcast was for prime-time, and that Koresh never even heard it played. Wasn't even tuned in to the radio when it aired -- so no reason to come out. If later they had given him a copy of the grossly twisted newswire transcript -- I'm certain Koresh would think he was at the mercy of evil itself.

I have clearly shown one of your shortcomings, if not two. That is, ignorance of the Bible and the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its contents. > I regard Christ as a myth. Because you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself. And to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion, I bet you do not even know what the word "Christ" means. Or which prophet used "Christ" to describe the "Son of Man". > I feel that there are far too many people > offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and > did. The only person who can really judge me is *me*. Yes. I agree with that. So we must learn first. Read the Bible. Come up with our own interpretation. Evaluate what is being said and by whom. Check the history books as well. Compare someone else's interpretation with your own. Then make a judgment. But I tell you the truth, 99% of what is being said in the Bible needs interpretation as much as a coffee cup needs interpretation. And remember, the Bible isn't a Guru's Esoteric Guide to Metaphysics. It doesn't take a theologian to understand what is being said. The Bible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and I addressed to people like you and I. These guys wrote down what they saw and heard. Is it their open diary--and they want to tell you something. And because they want you to know something, they make it very clear what they want you to know. They didn't encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric, but in simple straight-forward language. > I choose the > roads I travel, and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of > any given road or turn back -- and as long as I don't *always* turn > back, there's no shame in it. When I need help, I seek out my friends. You have chosen the road that avoids the Bible. You have chosen the road that avoids a confrontation with the living God because that road doesn't look appealing to you. You rather build your own road. One that goes far away from that confrontation. But be assured of this, you will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly. >And you don't have a clue about what I'm saying, either. Open your >eyes and SEE; open your ears and LISTEN. I'm not just spouting off >empty words. This is my LIFE, this is what gives me MEANING. I see what you mean. I hear what your saying. I am not degrading your life. But I have heard the same irrational excuses for years. There is nothing new in what you are saying. And by your own words, you are "spouting off" contradictions. If contradictions give you meaning, then your life must be sad. > I say my mother loves me. How do I know, you ask? I can point to > definite things she's done for me, and I can even just bring her to > you so you can ask her, face-to-face. > You say your deity loves you. How do you know, I ask? Bingo. For God so loved the world, he GAVE his only begotton to son so that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life. I look what God *did*. He has given his Son, even to his death, so that I can have hope in his resurrection and know that life isn't for nothing, but has glorious purpose. > You can't even convince me that it exists! Because you turn your eyes away from testimony and history. You choose to lie to yourself that he doesn't exist, for you ignore what has been said for thousands of years. You sound exactly, almost verbatim, like the Lazarus of Jesus's story starting in Luke 16:19. And the conclusion of that story is a bleak one. Lazarus wound up in hell. The story ends like this: "For if Lazarus doesn't even listen to Moses and the Prophets, he won't even believe if a man rose from the dead." > If any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot, promising untold > pleasures to me if I'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my > rationality for just this once, then I would choose 'hell'. I can > *not* lie to myself to placate another being, no matter how powerful > it is. Arrogance at its best. The fact is, you are not rational. Several specific cases have already been cited. And again with this new statement, you show more irrationality with regards to heaven. Jesus does tell you something of what to expect in heaven. Jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him. Jesus does not expect you to placate either. Jesus wants you to willingly come to him, but not as his grovelling slave, but rather as his brother who will share in his glorious riches. Why do you not pick up the Bible and read it for yourself. You maintain you have an open mind. See whether you are lying to yourself for yourself. >>Why would you want to live a good life? >>To you, you die and that's it. Don't contradict yourself. You have >>no reason to live a good life. It doesn't do you any good in the >>end. Your life doesn't do anybody else any good either because >>everyone dies anyway. So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading >>a good life is meaningless. Why do you do such a meaningless thing? >That paragraph demonstrates that you haven't listened to a single word >I've said. I do understand what you said. But that's is not what I feel went amiss here. You missed the point. Living a "good life" has no eternal consequences. Once they close the amusement park of life, to you that is the end. To you, it is over. To you, therefore, your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless. It has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth. But then you contradict yourself. From a previous post, you said doing evil things is bad. To you, it shouldn't matter if you do evil things or good things. It is all meaningless in the end anyway. So go rob a bank. Go tell someone you dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag. What's restraining you? Life after all, has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant. > In the same way, I think life is fun.

Jesus is alive. Jesus is NOT dead. So you (and your holy book) say. By the same token, therefore, Santa Claus delivers toys every xmas. Don't you see? I have NO REASON to believe that what you say is true. Please give me some reason that I can't similarly apply to Santa Claus. You have EVERY reason to believe that what Jesus says and the witnesses of Jesus say are true. But you choose to be unreasonable and "ignore" the reasons. By definition, "ignorance". Santa Claus is said to live at the North Pole and have a squad of elves and flying reindeer. Ever see a flying reindeer? Has anyone in human history seen a flying reindeer? Has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose blinks red? On the other hand, are people born in Bethlehem? Was Nebuchandezzar really a king? Was Daniel really one of his court officials? Were David and Solomon really kings of Israel and Judah? Was their really a king called Jehoachin? Did Sennecherib really attack Jerusalem 600 years before Christ? Did Sennacherib really lose his battle--and badly? Was there really a Caiaphas who interrogated Jesus? Yes, yes, yes . . . history verifies it. It is NONFICTION. Do you have a problem discerning truth from fiction? Perhaps you can't evaluate the context of Grimm's Fairy Tales apart from that of the Scientific American. I suppose you treat both with equal truthfulness or equal falsity. Is this what you are telling me? Or is it that just do want to read the Scientific American and find out that it's not a fairy tale? >Are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a >collection of verses in a book, and cannot be supported without >invoking them? Get real. Have you ever been to Zaire? Do you have to go there to be assured that there really is such a place? Given your irrationality, I take it you have never used a map in your life. > Why do you believe what you believe? Given the overwhelming evidence as well as my personal experience with the living God, I'd be an irrational unreasoning ignorant fool if I didn't follow Jesus.	3
